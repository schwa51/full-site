<h2>[N1] Crown District – <em>The Melancholy Crown</em></h2>
<p><strong>Goewen:</strong> Feels the weight of absence in the wind. Her senses echo with the cadence of long-lost speeches and formal song. The broken moon-tower's silhouette stirs a pang of ancestral pride and mourning.<br>
<strong>Damirror:</strong> Notes that this high vantage offers both danger and opportunity. He scans instinctively for line-of-sight paths and movement across the ruins.<br>
<strong>Flam:</strong> His eye is drawn to the architecture — massive stones placed with almost Dwarvish precision. He spits unconsciously; Elven grace, he thinks, crumbled easily enough.<br>
<strong>Studs:</strong> Clutches his pack a little tighter. The openness makes him feel exposed, but he also stares wide-eyed at the cracked amphitheatre, imagining stories once told here.</p>
<hr>
<h2>[N2] Ashen Garth – <em>The Veiled Garth</em></h2>
<p><strong>Goewen:</strong> The unnatural stillness feels holy and haunting. The preservation here is no accident. She walks as though entering a sacred bower.<br>
<strong>Damirror:</strong> Notes that the ground is undisturbed — too undisturbed. A scout’s instinct tells him something is either watching, or long gone but dangerous.<br>
<strong>Flam:</strong> Frowns at the cracked temple, muttering about the folly of Elven worship. But his gaze lingers on the still fountain, uneasy.<br>
<strong>Studs:</strong> Is captivated by the light and silence. He almost hums a tune, then stops himself, the hush too complete.</p>
<hr>
<h2>[N3] Vaultward Steps – <em>The Broken Hand</em></h2>
<p><strong>Goewen:</strong> Kneels near the collapsed forge. The metal whispers to her — not literally, but in memory. She brushes soot like a mourner.<br>
<strong>Damirror:</strong> Catches the glint of buried iron and crouches low — someone worked here after the fall. Scavengers? Or guardians?<br>
<strong>Flam:</strong> Stops mid-step. His breath catches. He removes his gloves and presses a hand to the stone anvil as if greeting an old friend left to ruin.<br>
<strong>Studs:</strong> The rhythmic sound unnerves him. He mutters about “not liking ghost hammers” and sticks close to the center of the group.</p>
<hr>
<h2>[N4] Riverfall Market – <em>The Hollow Commons</em></h2>
<p><strong>Goewen:</strong> Finds herself tracing the faded trade creeds carved into the stone. Her fingers know the words before her lips form them.<br>
<strong>Damirror:</strong> Steps carefully over scattered goods, noting crushed footprints — not theirs. Someone came through in haste.<br>
<strong>Flam:</strong> Tests the sturdiness of the Grand Stair. His instincts say this was once a defensible hub — now a deathtrap.<br>
<strong>Studs:</strong> Picks up a cracked, old apple carving and pockets it without thinking. “Waste not,” he says, eyes darting warily.</p>
<hr>
<h2>[N5] Gemstreet &amp; Vault Ends – <em>The Shattered Hearth</em></h2>
<p><strong>Goewen:</strong> Touches a vine overtaking the mural — it crumbles slightly. Her gaze lingers on the garden, her voice caught between grief and curiosity.<br>
<strong>Damirror:</strong> Eyes the half-burned campfire and drops to one knee. It’s recent. He brushes ash with practiced fingers, guessing how many days since it went cold.<br>
<strong>Flam:</strong> Scowls at the villas. “Jewels and gardens while war brewed beyond their walls,” he mutters. But his hand unconsciously rests on his axe.<br>
<strong>Studs:</strong> Is drawn to a cracked mosaic in the courtyard. He wipes it gently with a sleeve. “Someone lived here once,” he whispers, as if to himself.</p>
<hr>
<h2>[N6] The Fractured Watch – <em>The Hollow Gate</em></h2>
<p><strong>Goewen:</strong> Her eyes trace the ruined towers. She recalls tales of when the Watchfire Circle lit the sky. She wonders if it ever truly kept them safe.<br>
<strong>Damirror:</strong> Runs a hand along a vine-draped spear. Still sharp. This place has been reclaimed, but not forgotten.<br>
<strong>Flam:</strong> Stares at the breach with clenched fists. “They fought here,” he growls. “And someone ran.” He isn’t angry — he’s grieving.<br>
<strong>Studs:</strong> Shivers at the silence. He places a single small rock atop a rusted helm, the way his uncle taught him to mark a grave.</p>
<hr>
<h2>[N7] Watershade District – <em>The Murmuring Vein</em></h2>
<p><strong>Goewen:</strong> Watches the water ripple and reflect. The distortions fascinate her — like glimpsing another world through broken memory.<br>
<strong>Damirror:</strong> Eyes the canal, notes the slippery footing. He plots potential exits. The scents confuse him, floral and rot in equal measure.<br>
<strong>Flam:</strong> Snorts at the smell. But the wine vaults… those interest him more than he’d admit.<br>
<strong>Studs:</strong> Nearly slips on the wet stones. He swears quietly and mutters, “Not dying in a wine cellar, thank you very much.”</p>
<hr>
<h2>[N8] Artisan Residences – <em>The Quiet Ash</em></h2>
<p><strong>Goewen:</strong> Kneels at a scattered box of sculptor’s tools. She rights them, delicately, as if they could still be used.<br>
<strong>Damirror:</strong> Moves silently, scanning doorways and courtyards. These homes were left in haste. He’s sure of it.<br>
<strong>Flam:</strong> Picks up a toy hammer, stares at it, then gently sets it beside a hearth. His face is unreadable.<br>
<strong>Studs:</strong> Finds a half-sung lullaby etched into a wall. He reads it aloud softly, voice faltering. “This was a home,” he says.</p>
<hr>
<h2>[N9] Cradle of Memory – <em>The Forgotten Steps</em></h2>
<p><strong>Goewen:</strong> Her fingers trace Elven poetry inscribed into the walls. She murmurs it softly, even as Dwarven annotations interrupt the meter.<br>
<strong>Damirror:</strong> Notes a strange alignment of symbols and spiral paths. This place was designed to be remembered.<br>
<strong>Flam:</strong> Laughs once — harsh and short — at the Dwarven script, but falls silent as he reads it through.<br>
<strong>Studs:</strong> Is awed by the view. He doesn’t speak. He just stands there, still, like he belongs for a moment.</p>
<hr>
<h2>[N10] Ghosted Lane – <em>The Edge of Echoes</em></h2>
<p><strong>Goewen:</strong> Stares at the Wyr-tree, uncertain whether to kneel or draw her blade. It feels like something is missing — or waiting.<br>
<strong>Damirror:</strong> Freezes at the claw marks. Something came through here. Something not afraid of Elven ruins.<br>
<strong>Flam:</strong> His hand goes to his axe without thought. “Whatever made those,” he says, “I’d like to meet it — once.”<br>
<strong>Studs:</strong> Hugs the wall, eyes darting. “No birds, no mice, no thank you.”</p>
