<h1>RPG Summaries for 4–6 Players</h1>
<h2>Gran Meccanismo</h2>
<p><strong>Clockpunk intrigue and swashbuckling in Renaissance Florence</strong><br>
Gran Meccanismo sets players in a fantastical version of 1510s Italy where Da Vinci's inventions have reshaped the political and military landscape. Players take the role of mercenaries, nobles, spies, or inventors navigating the schemes of Florence, aided by spring-driven tanks, gliders, and water-clock computers. It uses the lightweight TRIPOD system, which emphasizes narrative flexibility and cinematic action, making it easy for a group of 4–6 players to jump into a stylish caper, duel, or conspiracy without complex mechanics getting in the way.</p>
<p>The game excels in one-shots or short campaigns full of social intrigue, infiltration, and clever problem-solving. Its greatest strengths are the distinctive setting, ease of play, and encouragement of theatrical play. However, it leans more on GM improvisation than deep system crunch, and the lack of published supplements may leave some groups wanting more ready-made content. Best for groups who enjoy historical fiction with a fantastical twist and favor storytelling over tactics.</p>
<h2>Harvest</h2>
<p><strong>Folk horror without a GM; storytelling soaked in dread</strong><br>
Harvest is a GM-less roleplaying game where players collaboratively tell the story of a remote island community that prospers through a yearly human sacrifice. Each player controls an archetype (like the Stranger or Dreamer) and takes turns introducing scenes, secrets, and tensions as the autumn ritual approaches. With a group of 4–6, the dynamic is slow-burn horror, rich with character conflict and eerie folklore.</p>
<p>Harvest shines when players lean into its emotional weight and thematic consistency. It's best for groups who enjoy dramatic improvisation, character-driven scenes, and moral ambiguity. The lack of a GM promotes shared storytelling, but requires buy-in and comfort with narrative leadership. It’s a focused experience that may not suit all moods, but when it lands, it delivers a haunting and unforgettable session.</p>
<h2>Mythic Bastionland</h2>
<p><strong>Arthurian hex-crawling with knights, myths, and legacy</strong><br>
Mythic Bastionland is a rules-light fantasy RPG of dreamlike knightly adventures, combining hex-crawl exploration, seasonal domain management, and otherworldly threats. Players each portray a knight in a mythic land full of strange encounters and glory-seeking quests. Its core system (descended from <em>Into the Odd</em>) resolves danger with simple die rolls, emphasizing creative play and fast outcomes.</p>
<p>Ideal for 4–6 players, the game encourages collective growth from lone errants to lords defending realms. Sessions move briskly, but decisions have weight—combat is lethal, oaths matter, and time passes. Pros include elegant campaign structure and evocative setting; cons lie in limited mechanical crunch and narrow class variety. It rewards players who buy into its knightly themes and embrace rulings over rules.</p>
<h2>Everyone is John</h2>
<p><strong>Chaotic comedy where players are voices in one man's head</strong><br>
In <em>Everyone is John</em>, all players (except the GM) are competing personalities inside a single character, each with a unique obsession. The game is comedic, fast-paced, and ideal for a single-session romp. Players bid Willpower points to control &quot;John&quot; and try to complete their own bizarre goals while sabotaging others.</p>
<p>The gameplay thrives on absurdity and group energy. With 4–6 players, chaos ensues quickly and hilariously. Pros include minimal prep, immediate laughs, and fast rules. Cons are lack of plot depth, limited replay variety, and a tone that may not suit all groups. Best used as a party game or one-shot palate cleanser.</p>
<h2>The 2400 Series</h2>
<p><strong>Modular lo-fi sci-fi microgames for any night</strong><br>
<em>2400</em> is a collection of ultra-light science fiction RPGs (like <em>Inner System Blues</em>, <em>Orbital Decay</em>, etc.), each with a focused tone and genre (cyberpunk, horror, space trucking). They share the same minimalist system: short trait lists, one-roll resolution, and flexible gear. Each is playable in a couple hours, requiring almost no prep.</p>
<p>For 4–6 players, <em>2400</em> games offer immediate immersion and creative freedom. They excel as pick-up sessions or short campaign arcs. Strengths include variety, accessibility, and emergent storytelling. Weaknesses are lack of advancement systems, minimal tactical depth, and reliance on genre familiarity. Best for players who value improvisation and genre exploration.</p>
<h2>Trilemma Adventures</h2>
<p><strong>System-neutral fantasy dilemmas in one-page bursts</strong><br>
<em>Trilemma Adventures</em> is a compilation of one- and two-page fantasy scenarios, rich with imaginative locations and moral quandaries. Each adventure includes an isometric map, intriguing factions or entities, and a unique twist or danger. GMs can drop these into any fantasy system and run them with minimal prep.</p>
<p>With 4–6 players, each adventure becomes a memorable, self-contained challenge—often weird, perilous, or open-ended. Pros are creativity, brevity, and visual design. Cons include sparse mechanical detail and the need for system adaptation. Great for GMs seeking evocative plug-and-play content or to spark longer campaigns.</p>
<h2>The Quiet Year</h2>
<p><strong>Map-drawing game about rebuilding and uncertainty</strong><br>
<em>The Quiet Year</em> is a GM-less storytelling game where players collaboratively draw a map and narrate the events of a year in a post-collapse community. Each turn represents a week, with random prompts guiding what happens. As seasons change, players face scarcity, conflict, discoveries—and eventually, the arrival of the mysterious Frost Shepherds.</p>
<p>For 4–6 players, it's a reflective, emergent experience full of tension and creativity. The game offers strong narrative feel, world-building joy, and collaborative control. Its cons are its narrow focus and the lack of traditional character roleplay. It works best as a mood-setting one-shot, a session zero for another RPG, or a standalone story about hope, fear, and transformation.</p>
