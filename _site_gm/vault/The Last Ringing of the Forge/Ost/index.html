<p><strong>The Ruins of Ost-in-Edhil – Session Packet</strong></p>
<p><em>An Exploration Scenario for The One Ring Second Edition</em></p>
<hr>
<h3>Session Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Setting:</strong> Ruins of Ost-in-Edhil, Eregion<br>
<strong>Tone:</strong> Wistful, decaying majesty; quiet danger; echoes of loss and ambition<br>
<strong>Purpose:</strong> Player-heroes explore ruins in search of ancient truths tied to the forging of the Rings of Power and secrets that may aid them in their coming journey into Moria.</p>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>Use the node map and narrative prompts as a loose framework. Allow free exploration or guide by events (e.g., triggering visions, enemy approach, Anárion's NPCs urging a detour).</p>
<hr>
<h3>Key Narrative Breadcrumbs</h3>
<h4>1. Ring Lore Discoveries</h4>
<p><strong>Broken Forge-Hall (Node N3 - Vaultward Steps)</strong><br>
<em>Clue:</em> In a soot-stained alcove, heat or pressure reveals runes: <em>&quot;Forged for wisdom, betrayed by fire.&quot;</em><br>
<em>Effect:</em> Elven/Dwarven PCs recognize this as the forging creed of the Gwaith-i-Mírdain. Implies unfinished or hidden works.</p>
<p><strong>Echoing Halls (Node N5 - Gemstreet &amp; Vault Ends)</strong><br>
<em>Clue:</em> A children’s scroll sealed in roots: <em>&quot;A ring of stars with no end and no master.&quot;</em><br>
<em>Effect:</em> Lore test links this to the concept of a &quot;Ring of Accord,&quot; resonating with the Jewel of Narvi.</p>
<p><strong>Court of Starfall (Node N6/N10)</strong><br>
<em>Clue:</em> Faded mural of Elves and Dwarves forging together. One figure holds a silver-veined sapphire.<br>
<em>Effect:</em> The Jewel of Narvi is foreshadowed. Dwarf PC may feel a strange pull or inspiration.</p>
<hr>
<h4>2. Moria-Linked Secrets</h4>
<p><strong>The Forgotten Steps (Node N9 - Cradle of Memory)</strong><br>
<em>Clue:</em> Stone fragment reads: <em>&quot;Durin’s bridge holds but one twin—seek its mirror in the west.&quot;</em><br>
<em>Effect:</em> Reference to a second, little-known westward route through Moria.</p>
<p><strong>Fountain of Still Light (Node N2 - Ashen Garth)</strong><br>
<em>Clue:</em> Reflections show not PCs, but ancient dwarves traveling east under a glowing gem.<br>
<em>Effect:</em> May trigger Shadow point if viewed too long, or Inspiration on successful Insight test.</p>
<p><strong>Shrine of Varda (Node N10 - Ghosted Lane)</strong><br>
<em>Clue:</em> Dwarvish runes shaped like stars reference a place called &quot;The Mouth of Moria.&quot;<br>
<em>Effect:</em> Knowledge valuable to Balin or later maps.</p>

<h3>NPC Opportunities (Anárion’s Company)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Anárion:</strong> May try to withhold access to some vaults or steer players away from key clues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maeril:</strong> Reacts emotionally in the Court of Starfall or Echoing Halls—may share memories or poetry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Roric:</strong> Is silent but reverent in forge locations; could share a dream or fragment of ancestral memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Garan:</strong> Cynical and guarded, but reacts strongly to Shrine of Varda; fears what's awakening in Moria.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Optional Encounters</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Misty Intruder:</strong> A shadowy figure glimpsed in the distance; never confronts unless pursued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Echo Trap:</strong> A scroll case in N5 explodes in bright sound and light if opened without a riddle solved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Silent Guardian:</strong> In N6, signs that a guardian once stood here—missing now. Was it moved… or awakened?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>GM Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use environmental storytelling and mood to anchor players in the melancholy of lost greatness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer choices: pursue deeper mysteries or report findings to Balin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reward Lore, Insight, and Song—this is a place of memory and meaning, not only danger.</p>
