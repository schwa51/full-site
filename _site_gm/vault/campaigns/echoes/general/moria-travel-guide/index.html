  <h3>Travel in Moria:</h3>
<p>A Journey starts by the players choosing from one of the four roles, with all roles needing to be covered. A player may cover more than one role except for the Guide. Roles are important during Journey events.</p>
<h4>Travel Roles:<br></h4>
<p><strong>Guide-</strong> In charge of all decisions concerning route, rest, and supplies. <strong>TRAVEL</strong><br>
<strong>Look-­out-</strong> In charge of keeping watch. <strong>AWARENESS</strong><br>
<strong>Scout-</strong> In charge of setting up camp, opening new trails. <strong>EXPLORE</strong><br>
<strong>Delvers</strong>- their function is to ensure the safety of the marching Company, inspecting tunnels, monitoring environmental conditions, and in general mitigating risks connected to the structures of an underground complex. <strong>CRAFT</strong><br></p>
<p>As soon as the Company leaves, the Guide makes a first Marching Test, and counts a number of miles along the journey path based on the outcome of the <strong>TRAVEL</strong> roll:<br>
♦ If the <strong>TRAVEL</strong> roll was a failure, the Company barely makes any progress, advancing by 2 miles on the journey path. Then, an event occurs.<br>
♦ If the <strong>TRAVEL</strong> roll was a success, the Guide has struck a good path and the Company advances 6 miles, plus 2 additional miles for each Success icon. Then, an event occurs.</p>
<p>Events are determined by the loremaster rolling a skill die to choose the party member who will test the indicated skill:<br></p>
<table class="fancy-table table--half">
  <colgroup>
    <col style="width:33.33%">
    <col style="width:33.33%">
    <col style="width:33.33%">
  </colgroup>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Success die roll</th>
      <th>Target</th>
      <th>Skill</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1–2</td>
      <td>Scouts</td>
      <td><strong>EXPLORE</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3–4</td>
      <td>Look-outs</td>
      <td><strong>AWARENESS</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5–6</td>
      <td>Delvers</td>
      <td><strong>CRAFT</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
The target then tests the indicated skill using the Skill Die. The Loremaster then roles a feat die to determine the event occurring according to the following table:<br>
<table class="fancy-table table--full">
  <colgroup>
    <col style="width:20%">
    <col style="width:24%">
    <col style="width:36%">
    <col style="width:20%">
  </colgroup>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Feat Die Roll</th>
      <th>Event</th>
      <th>Consequences of the Skill Roll</th>
      <th>Fatigue Points Gained</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Eye rune</td>
      <td>Deadly Dark</td>
      <td>If the skill roll fails, the target is Wounded, and the Lore-master raises the Eye Awareness of the Company by 1.</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1–2</td>
      <td>The Long Dark of Moria</td>
      <td>If the skill roll fails, everyone in the Company gains 2 Shadow points (Dread).</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3–5</td>
      <td>Watchful Eyes</td>
      <td>If the skill roll fails, the target gains 1 Shadow point (Dread), and the Lore-master raises the Eye Awareness of the Company by 1.</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6–9</td>
      <td>Endlessly Branching Stairs and Passages</td>
      <td>If the skill roll fails, add 1 day to the length of the journey, and the target gains 1 additional Fatigue. In addition, regardless of whether the roll is successful or not, roll on the Random Chamber Generator.</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>The Right Way</td>
      <td>If the skill roll succeeds, reduce the length of the journey by 1 day.</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>G rune</td>
      <td>Dread and Wonder of Moria</td>
      <td>If the skill roll fails, the target gains 1 Shadow point (Dread). If the skill roll succeeds, everyone in the Company regains 1 Hope instead.</td>
      <td>–</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>At the end of the journey, accumulated fatigue is recorded on the player's sheet. Fatigue can be reduced with a roll of <strong>TRAVEL</strong>. A success reduces the total Fatigue of a Player-­hero by 1, plus 1 point for each icon rolled.</p>
<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>The following modifications to the underground journey rules can be used when the Player-­heroes venture into Moria in search of a place they’ve heard about but lack precise information concerning its location (for example, a place they have discovered using the Gather Rumours undertaking).<br>
The minimum requirement is to know the approximate area where the Landmark is supposed to be found.<br>
To find such a place, the Company must use the normal rules for underground journeys to reach the approximate region. Once there, the Company must make a Seeking Test, to pinpoint the precise location and reach it.<br>
A Seeking Test is made rolling <strong>SCAN</strong>, modified by the Landmark’s Renown: if the Landmark is Famous, the roll is resolved normally; if the Landmark is Obscure, the roll loses (1d); if the Landmark is Hidden, it can be found only with a Magical success (if the Company has found enough clues pointing to the Landmark, this one may be considered Obscure for the sake of the Seeking Test).<br>
♦ If the Test is successful, the Player-­ heroes either find the Landmark sought — or, if the gathered rumours were false in the first place, they confirm that it is not nearby.<br>
♦ If the Test fails, the Company does not find the Landmark and must roll once on the Moria Journey Events table.</p>
