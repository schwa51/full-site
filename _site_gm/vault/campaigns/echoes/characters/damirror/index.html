  <h2>What the Fellowship Knows About Damirror</h2>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Race: Ranger of the North</strong> <em>(Dúnedain)</em></h4>
<p><em>The Rangers of the North are the last remnant of the Dúnedain, heirs of Númenor and protectors of the Free Peoples. Though few in number and often mistaken for wandering vagabonds, they are tireless sentinels who walk unseen through wild places, guarding the innocent from darkness. Their lineage is noble, their purpose grave, and their knowledge of the wild unmatched.</em></p>
<p>Damirror is a quiet and guarded figure within the Fellowship. He offers little about his past, and when asked, gives short, practical answers. His silence is not coldness—just a habit forged by caution. He prefers to keep his own counsel, speaking only when needed.</p>
<p>Others have picked up on subtle tensions. He watches hobbits with narrowed eyes, and there’s a sense he holds a private grudge—though he’s never said as much. No stories follow him, no songs. Not yet. But his seriousness, his practicality, and his sharp eyes leave an impression.</p>
<p>The Fellowship might see him as a killjoy, a grim figure among more light-hearted company. But there’s also the sense that he’s reliable. That he watches their backs even when they forget to ask.</p>
<p>No nickname has stuck to him yet. But Damirror walks quietly at their side, his motives unreadable, his gaze sharp—and for now, his loyalty holds.</p>
