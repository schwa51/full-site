  <h2>History</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Last Watchers of the South Downs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“We held the line. Not against orcs… but against kin who had forgotten who they were.”<br>
—Captain Herion, Spirit of Arnor</p>
<p><a href="/vault/campaigns/echoes/locations/barad-celen/">Barad Celen</a> was a small stone outpost in the South Downs, erected during the last century of Arnor’s unity to guard an old crossroads and a sealed Dwarven cache—the Stoneward Hearth—placed there during the High King's time as a symbol of trust between Men and Dwarves.</p>
<p>Herion, a veteran captain and son of a respected Ranger, was appointed warden of Barad Celen. Though not highborn, he was a man of strong convictions and quiet authority. His garrison was small but loyal—many were veterans, scouts, and idealists who still believed in the unity of the Dúnedain.</p>
<p>After the death of King Eärendur in T.A. 861, the realm split between his sons—Arthedain, Cardolan, and Rhudaur. Herion’s outpost, once a symbol of shared protection, now stood on a disputed border between Arthedain and the breakaway realm of Cardolan.</p>
<p>For a time, Barad Celen continued to fly the banner of unity. Herion refused to choose sides, believing the division a temporary madness, and continued to send messages to all three kingdoms calling for reason.</p>
<p>But that message was not welcomed.</p>
<p>One spring, a company of soldiers bearing the crest of Tharbad—a new stronghold of Cardolan—arrived under the pretense of parley. They demanded that Barad Celen surrender and swear loyalty to Cardolan. Herion refused.</p>
<p>That night, they attacked under the cover of darkness.</p>
<p>The garrison was small. The defenders were overwhelmed. Herion was mortally wounded, and the scouts Corion and Elien were cut down while attempting to flee north with a warning. The survivors died one by one. There were no enemy banners raised, no burial pyres lit, and no messengers returned.</p>
<p>Barad Celen was erased from the records of Cardolan—its silence mistaken as surrender, its men forgotten as traitors.</p>
<p>No king called them home. No cairn was raised. Their oaths—to unity, to watchfulness, and to honor—remained unfulfilled.</p>
<p>Now, only their spirits remain—echoes of loyalty that cannot fade until their watch is ended.</p>
<p>The Rune-Key, once a ceremonial gift exchanged in peace between Elves, Dwarves, and Men, has returned to the ruin. Its presence rekindles the oath and stirs the spirits from their long slumber.</p>
<p>They wait not for vengeance, but for remembrance.</p>
<p>They wait for release.</p>
