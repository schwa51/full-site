  <h1>Balin Son of Fundin</h1>
  
</div>
  
  <h6>Name: Balin, Son of Fundin</h6>
<h6>Race: Dwarf of Durin's Folk</h6>
<h6>Occupation: Counselor to Kings</h6>
<h6>Age: Born in 2763</h6>
<h6>Region: Resides under the Mountain, but travels widely across the North</h6>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>&quot;Unlike many Dwarves, Balin is genuinely interested in other folks and takes kindly to Hobbits especially. Of the Dwarves of Thorin’s Company, Balin is the only one still associating with Gandalf long after the death of Smaug, as he shares the Wizard’s concern about the growing Shadow.</p>
<p>In addition to that, Balin aims to restore the strength and prominence of the Dwarves in Eriador, whether through direct action, or by setting into motion agents who might affect the change he wishes to see. Like all his folk, he hates Orcs and their ilk, and seeks in every way
to drive them back wherever he can. His adventuring has made him wiser and more cautious though, and he often counsels patience and observation as a tactic, versus rash or violent action.</p>
<p>Balin is eager to know anything that can be learned regarding Dwarf-holds fallen to the Enemy, and actively encourages his allies to scout those places or rid them of any foul denizens therein. In particular, Balin is interested to find out all he can about Moria, where his father was slain. Together with two of his fellow survivors of Thorin’s company — Ori and Óin — he speaks often about entering Khazad-dûm and exploring it. So far, King Dáin of Erebor has cautioned them against such an endeavour, though it is clear that they are not to be dissuaded.&quot; Pg. 213 TOR</p>
<h2>Role in the Story</h2>
<p>Patron to the Fellowship. In addition to the advantages he grants them as listed below, he is kind and generous, a friend to hobbits and among the most open and level-headed of dwarves. He can provide important material for quests and introduce the company to his wide network of acquaintances.</p>
<h2>Traits</h2>
<p>Eager and Honorable
Fellowship Bonus: +1
Advantage: Balin's Council. You can spend Fellowship points to make a combat roll favored</p>
<h2>Quotes</h2>
<p>“I always meant to see you safe (if possible), over the mountains.”
— <em>The Hobbit</em>, Chapter 4: “Over Hill and Under Hill”</p>
<p>“It is not easy even for a dwarf to catch a dwarf napping.”<br>
— <em>The Hobbit</em>, Chapter 2: “Roast Mutton”</p>
