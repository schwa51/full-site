  <h2>Session Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>Session number: 1</li>
<li>Title: The Silent Hoofprints</li>
<li>Date: March 25, 2965 TA</li>
<li>Location(s): Bree and a nearby copse of trees</li>
<li>Journey Length: na</li>
<li>Fellowship phase? no</li>
</ul>
<h2>Major Events &amp; Turning Points</h2>
<p>The heroes spoke with the bribed north man <a href="/vault/campaigns/echoes/npcs/halric_of_the_north/">Halric of the North</a>, but he was not bribed but threatened to stay quite. He was persuaded to talk with Flam. He reveals that one of the men may have resembled one of the men of the south</p>
<p><a href="/vault/campaigns/echoes/characters/studs-terkel/">Studs Terkel</a> and <a href="/vault/campaigns/echoes/characters/flam/">Flam</a> also spoke with the dwarves <a href="/vault/campaigns/echoes/npcs/loda_ironfoot/">Loda Ironfoot</a>. Studs confronted them with the pouch of silver. A fight almost broke out, but Studs was able to calm things down and flam was even able to talk them into a little business, and bought an axe head</p>
<p><a href="/vault/campaigns/echoes/characters/damirror/">Damirror</a> and <a href="/vault/campaigns/echoes/characters/goewen/">Goewen</a> investigate the stable. Goewen talks with Barley and persuades him to tell her about the blacksmith apprentice <a href="/vault/campaigns/echoes/npcs/tobin_underbough/">Tobin Underbough</a>- that he’s had more money the past 2 days and has been spending freely at the pony.</p>
<p>The company travels down the greenway where they spy the thieves in a grove of trees- the two men of the south and the apprentice. Geowen hid outside the grove with her bow ready while the rest of the fellowship confronted them. Studs was so persuasive, that he got them to tell the fellowship their story. <a href="/vault/campaigns/echoes/npcs/baran_the_scarred/">Baran the scarred</a> and <a href="/vault/campaigns/echoes/npcs/kadran_of_harondor/">Kadran of Harondor</a> were soldiers in Rohan. Baran was a captain. He had saved Kadran’s life in a battle once, so Kadran is fiercely loyal. Baran was injured, leading to his limp and burned face. His fiancé left him due to his scars, which drove him to despair. He left Rohan and he and Kadran had been living as outlaws ever since. They were hoping this job stealing the horse would net them enough money to stop thieving and go straight again.</p>
<p>The fellowship takes them back to Bree, where they argue for mercy before the magistrate. He agrees, and they are sentenced to a work/rehabilitation program where they work during the day and spend the night in the cells. This is probationary and will depend on how their behavior. The apprentice ran off and later slunk back into town. He is currently in prison. Only his brother is mad about this and everyone else thinks it’s well deserved.</p>
<p>The fellowship participates in a council where they accept <a href="/vault/campaigns/echoes/npcs/balin-fellowship-patron/">Balin Son of Fundin</a> as their main patron. He promises them rich adventures and endeavors in search of lost lore and hidden legends.</p>
<h2>Player Spotlight</h2>

<p>Goewen: She did not get much time in the spotlight. She did some crucial investigating at the pony, but this wasn’t well appreciated</p>
<p>Dwarf of Durin's Folk:</p>
<p>Studs Terkel: He convinced the judge to have pity on Baran</p>
<h2>Mechanical Tracking</h2>
