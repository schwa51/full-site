#  All Hallow’s Scream

##  Scenario {.rubric}
The Murder Mavens are invited to a lavish Halloween party at the flamboyant Vidal estate—home to a retired B-movie filmmaker and his adoring spouse, where Old Hollywood kitsch meets small-town gossip. Costumes, props, and cocktails abound… until a scream slices through the music and the doors stop feeling so welcoming. The party isn’t over; it’s just become a case.

##  What to Expect {.rubric}
**System:** *Brindlewood Bay* — cozy mystery that tilts toward the uncanny, built on conversational moves and clue-driven theorizing.  
**This one-shot:** A theatrical, social whodunnit set at a crowded holiday soirée. Expect gossip and rivalries, vivid suspects, and a slow creep from charming to unsettling—no spoilers, only atmosphere and suspicion.
