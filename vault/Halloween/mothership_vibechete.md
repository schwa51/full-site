# 🔪 Vibechete!

## 👻 Scenario Hook
Upstairs Corp’s abandoned Hodder Forest Reserve Habitat drifts at the edge of Corespace, furnishing wealthy corporate scions a party spot away from their gilded cages’ ever-present surveillance.
Learning the domed habitat was recently condemned to the orbital scrapyards, you and your friends head over for one last shindig. It’s the anniversary of a mysterious accident that resulted in 50 workers’ deaths and the park’s closure: urban legends swirl, hearts race...
Something stirs in Hodder Forest’s depths.
