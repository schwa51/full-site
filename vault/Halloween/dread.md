# üß± Dread {.smear}

##  Scenario {.smear}
It starts as a dare, or a detour, or a storm that forces you off the road. Doors lock. Radios die. The lights flicker as something moves just out of sight. You can try the smart thing‚Äîthe safe thing‚Äîor you can reach for the one chance that might save you.

##  What to Expect {.smear}
**System:** *Dread* ‚Äî a tense horror RPG where every risky move means **pulling a block from a tumbling tower**. Success raises the stakes; hesitation courts failure; and if the tower falls, someone is **out of the story**. You‚Äôll build characters with questionnaires, play to fragile hopes, and let the tower decide when bravery becomes catastrophe. 
**Table feel:** mounting suspense, hard choices, and a steady drumbeat of **anxiety vs. hope**‚Äîperfect for a one-night Halloween session. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Content Warnings {.smear}
- Intense suspense, panic, and feelings of helplessness  
- Sudden shocks; peril, injury, and **character death**  
- Psychological horror; isolation, stalking, and paranoia  
- Optional gore/body horror depending on group tone
