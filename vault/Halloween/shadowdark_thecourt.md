# 🦇 The Count, the Castle, & the Curse

## 👻 Scenario
A storm rolls over a foreign land as your carriage stops before a looming castle. You remember the letter, the invitation, and then— teeth, and darkness. Now you’ve awakened inside the Count’s domain with the night pressing in and midnight drawing near.

## 🧰 What to Expect
**System:** *Shadowdark* — fast, tense fantasy where light, time, and choices matter. Expect quick rulings, real danger, and hard calls under pressure.  
**This one-shot:** A gothic escape through a labyrinthine castle. The tone is cat-and-mouse suspense with rising dread, escalating encounters, and a relentless sense of the clock. Temptations whisper—power at a cost—while exploration, stealth, and nerve decide who makes it out before the stroke of midnight.

## ⚠️ Content Warnings
- Gothic horror and predatory pursuit  
- Blood, vampirism, and themes of losing humanity
