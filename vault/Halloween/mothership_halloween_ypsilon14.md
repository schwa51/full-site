# 👻 The Haunting of Ypsilon 14

## 🌌 Scenario Hook
On the desolate edges of known space, a lonely mining station clings to life. Its lights flicker, its crew grows desperate, and whispers say something unnatural is moving through the corridors. When you arrive, the question isn’t just whether you can survive—but whether you’ll uncover the truth before it’s too late.

## 🧰 What to Expect
**System:** *Mothership* — a lean, high-stress sci-fi horror RPG where panic, injury, and bad decisions spiral quickly.  
**The Haunting of Ypsilon 14:** A self-contained one-shot built for suspense and dread. Expect:  
- **Slow-burn tension** and growing unease  
- **Isolation** in a failing, claustrophobic environment  
- **Classic haunted-station atmosphere** in deep space  

## ⚠️ Content Warnings
- Paranoia, fear, and helplessness  
- Violence and injury  
- Body horror and disturbing imagery  
- Isolation, entrapment, and creeping dread
