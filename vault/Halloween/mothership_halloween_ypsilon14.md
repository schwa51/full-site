# The Haunting of Ypsilon 14

## üåå Scenario
During a routine cargo job on a remote asteroid mining base you learn that one of the workers has disappeared. No blood, no body, no record of the airlock opening. Just gone. And that's not the only unexplainable thing that's been happening at Ypsilon 14... What is the alien material at the heart of this asteroid? What do the weird events around the base have to do with it? Who, if anyone, can be trusted? And can you make it out alive before you also disappear?

## What to Expect
**System:** *Mothership* ‚Äî a lean, high-stress sci-fi horror RPG where panic, injury, and bad decisions spiral quickly.  
**The Haunting of Ypsilon 14:** A self-contained one-shot built for suspense and dread. Expect:  
- **Slow-burn tension** and growing unease  
- **Isolation** in a failing, claustrophobic environment  
- **Classic haunted-station atmosphere** in deep space  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Content Warnings
- Paranoia, fear, and helplessness  
- Violence and injury  
- Body horror and disturbing imagery  
- Isolation, entrapment, and creeping dread
