# THE YELLOW GOO

If damaged, the monster will **retreat to its pod** in the **Mine Antechamber (9)**, where it will remain for **10 minutes of real time** as the **Yellow Goo** repairs its injuries — healing its **Health**, but not its **Hits**.

## Contact with the Yellow Goo

Anyone who comes into **direct contact** with the Yellow Goo must make a **Body Save at Disadvantage** or have their **biology slowly rewritten** from the inside as the Goo attempts to “heal” them.

### Initial Effects
- The first sign of the change is an **aversion to water**.  
- The victim **regains all Health** and gains **Advantage on Strength checks**.

### Terminal Phase
After **2d10 hours**, the victim begins to **melt**, losing **1d10 Health every 10 minutes** until they collapse into a **puddle of Yellow Goo**.
