### **Briefing**

Balonov Downport City was once a thriving mining colony, now a decaying post-industrial ruin of rust, rain, and desperation. Beneath the city lie *The Bunkers*—a sprawling labyrinth of abandoned factories and smelters repurposed for illegal raves and hideouts for the destitute.  

Nuanix Biolabs reports that **Sample #78**, a bio-engineered organism, has escaped into this warren of decay. Tracking signals have located it deep within *The Bunkers*. It is large, fast, and lethally aggressive.
