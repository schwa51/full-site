### **Briefing**

Absalom Station was constructed as an orbital barracks and now houses tens of thousands of desperate settlers, each hoping to find work or passage elsewhere. Grimm is a member of the Vermin Patrol, a group tasked with hunting and exterminating infestations across the station. She’s known for her paranoid vigilance—checking every corner twice—which has made her one of the best at her job.

Recently, Grimm has gone missing. Her absence has been noted by coworkers, but none are willing to report it. Accessing their records or convincing them to cooperate reveals her quarters: Room 238, Pleasance Rooms—a decrepit former brig turned low-rent housing.
