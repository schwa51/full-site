### **Briefing**

Lera Zima, an independent journalist, has published several exposés against the **Spiritual Garden Society (SGS)**, a powerful faith-corporation operating from orbit above Ogroitum. Her reports feature interviews with disillusioned ex-members and whistleblowers, accusing the SGS of coercion and psychological manipulation.  

Her work, released via the *Ogroitum Inquest* newsfeed, has damaged the Society’s reputation and spurred families to question their involvement. The SGS claims her reporting constitutes harassment and defamation—and seeks to *“ensure this does not happen again.”*  

Zima’s investigation now extends beyond the Society: she’s been pursuing a story on **Albert’s Shipyard**, a shady dealer accused of selling unsafe vessels. Her trail has led her into deep space aboard a salvage ship, the *Emberjack*.
