### **Briefing**

The colony world of **Veldat** is a marginal venture—barely habitable, poorly supplied, and populated by aging colonists clinging to independence. Most of the locals make their living as *crabbers*, hunting the indigenous “fancy crabs,” a dinner-plate–sized species attracted to reflective materials.  

These creatures emerge at night to strip metal and glass from colony machinery, causing power failures and accidents. Bounties for their claws or eggs (400cr each) provide much of the colony’s limited income. Reidar Beech, once a reliable crabber, is now wanted for unpaid child support—and rumor has it he’s gone deeper underground, chasing higher-paying crab nests beneath Split Log.  

The locals at *Old Raindrop Inn* last saw Beech boasting of a big haul in “the deep tunnels.” He and his crew descended into the earth, promising to bring back enough eggs to make them rich.
