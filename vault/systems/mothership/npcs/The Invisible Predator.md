## **THE INVISIBLE PREDATOR**

### **Combat Statistics**
- **Combat**: 70
- **Speed**: 50  
- **Instinct**: 35
- **Hits**: 3(40)
- **Attacks**: 
  - **Claws**: 2d10+2d10 damage
  - **Devour**: 4d10 damage (special)

### **Physical Description** 
The creature is completely **invisible to human sight** - a nightmare made of empty air and death. When viewed through infrared goggles, it appears as a **fuzzy, not-quite-humanoid shape** with distinctly alien proportions. Its **three-toed feet** leave barely perceptible tracks, and it moves with an unsettling, predatory grace through spaces that seem too small for something of its apparent size [1].

**Size**: Large enough to devour a human whole, yet capable of moving through cramped mining tunnels and ventilation systems. When it clings to walls and ceilings, surfaces show **barely perceptible residue** where its alien flesh makes contact.

### **Behavioral Characteristics**

**Hunting Pattern**: This is a **methodical stalker** that observes its prey silently before striking. It doesn't rush into combat - instead, it **picks off victims one by one**, disappearing them completely without a trace. Every 10 minutes of real time, it claims another victim from the station [1].

**Movement**: **Near-silent** despite its size, moving through the station's corridors like a whisper of death. It can **cling to walls and ceilings** with ease, allowing it to attack from any angle. It uses the **ventilation system** to move between areas undetected.

**Intelligence**: The creature is **cunning and patient**. It uses **biosonar and echolocation** to hunt since it's blind, making it vulnerable to **loud or strange noises** that can temporarily confuse or distract it.

### **Special Abilities & Weaknesses**

**Devour**: Its most terrifying ability - the creature's **powerful suction** and **circular rows of sharp teeth** can completely consume a victim. Once caught, players must make a **Body Save every round or take a critical hit**. Victims **vanish chunk by chunk** as they enter the monster's **invisible digestive tract**, leaving absolutely no trace behind [1].

**Water Vulnerability**: The creature is **cautious around water**, avoiding it whenever possible and even **abandoning attacks** to stay dry. This explains Mike's sudden aversion to water and his destruction of the shower - he was infected and could sense the creature's fear [1].

**Regeneration**: When damaged, the monster retreats to **its pod in the Mine Antechamber** where the **Yellow Goo heals its injuries** over 10 minutes of real time. It regains Health but not Hits during this process [1].

### **Origins & Nature**

This is an **ancient alien being** that was sleeping in a pod within the meteorite, held in **interstellar stasis** during some unimaginably long voyage through space. The mining operations **disturbed its slumber**, awakening a creature that has been traveling between stars since before human civilization began [1].

The **Yellow Goo** is part of its biology - a **healing substance** that rewrites victims at the molecular level, like a cocoon that breaks down and remakes creatures according to alien design. The goo grants incredible healing and strength, but ultimately **melts victims into more of itself** [1].

### **Roleplay Notes**

**Presence**: Describe **sudden temperature drops**, **unexplained sounds** (soft clicking of echolocation), and **Prince the cat's reactions** - hissing, backing away, staring at empty spaces with dilated pupils.

**Attacks**: Never describe the creature directly. Instead focus on the **effects** - "Something unseen lifts Jerome off his feet," "Invisible claws rake across your arm," "You hear the wet sound of circular teeth grinding."

**Psychological Horror**: The true terror comes from the **complete invisibility** - players know something is hunting them but can never see it coming. The only warning signs are **three-toed footprints** visible through infrared and **Prince's supernatural awareness** [1].

**Tactical Behavior**: The monster is **patient and methodical**. It will **retreat when damaged**, **avoid water at all costs**, and **pick off isolated victims** rather than face a group head-on. It's survived an interstellar journey - it knows how to hunt efficiently.
