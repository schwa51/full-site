am# Mothership RPG: A Complete Game Overview

Mothership is a sci-fi horror roleplaying game where you and your crew try to survive in the most inhospitable environment in the universe—outer space. The game creates intense experiences as players excavate dangerous derelict spacecraft, explore strange alien worlds, exterminate hostile life, and examine the horrors that threaten their every move [1].

## Core Atmosphere and Feel

Mothership captures the tone of classic sci-fi horror films like Aliens, Event Horizon, and Dead Space. The game emphasizes **survival horror** over heroic adventure—players are ordinary people thrust into extraordinary and terrifying circumstances. The atmosphere is deliberately oppressive: space is lonely, resources are scarce, corporations are exploitative, and something horrific is always lurking just out of sight. Players often work for "The Company"—a faceless megacorporation that treats them as expendable assets [2].

The game focuses on **psychological tension** through its Stress and Panic mechanics. Characters accumulate Stress from failed saves, witnessing horrors, or enduring harsh conditions. High Stress makes characters more likely to Panic, potentially leading to breakdowns, phobias, or dangerous outbursts that can doom the entire crew [1].

## Character Classes and Specialization

Mothership features four distinct character classes, each with unique strengths and weaknesses [1]:

**Teamsters** are the working-class heroes—mechanics, engineers, and blue-collar crew members. Think Ellen Ripley from Aliens. They excel at practical skills like mechanical repair and zero-gravity work, and can re-roll results on the Panic table once per session, representing their resilience under pressure.

**Scientists** are researchers, doctors, and intellectuals who slice open aliens and analyze strange phenomena. They start with skills like Biology and Chemistry, but their analytical nature makes them prone to stress—when a Scientist fails a Sanity Save, nearby crew members also gain Stress.

**Androids** are synthetic beings with cold, unsettling personalities. They don't need oxygen and have superior stats, but their inhuman nature makes others uncomfortable—Fear Saves made in the presence of Androids have Disadvantage.

**Marines** are combat specialists trained to "shoot bugs and chew bubblegum." They're effective fighters and work well in groups, but their military training makes them dangerous when they panic—when a Marine has a breakdown, nearby crew must make Fear Saves.

Each class has distinct starting equipment loadouts: Excavation (crowbars, laser cutters), Exploration (survival gear, survey equipment), Extermination (weapons, combat gear), and Examination (medical and scientific tools) [1].

## Core Rules and Dice System

Mothership uses a **d100 system** built entirely around 10-sided dice. The basic mechanic is simple: roll equal to or under your relevant Stat or Save to succeed [1].

**Stats** represent your capabilities under extreme pressure:
- **Strength**: Physical power and endurance
- **Speed**: Reaction time and agility  
- **Intellect**: Knowledge and problem-solving
- **Combat**: Fighting ability

**Saves** represent resistance to different threats:
- **Sanity**: Resisting logical inconsistencies and cosmic horror
- **Fear**: Coping with emotional trauma
- **Body**: Physical reflexes and disease resistance
- **Armor**: Protection from physical damage

**Skills** add bonuses to your Stats: Trained (+10), Expert (+15), or Master (+20). You roll under your Stat plus relevant Skill bonus to succeed [1].

**Advantage and Disadvantage** modify rolls—with Advantage, roll twice and take the better result; with Disadvantage, roll twice and take the worse result. **Critical successes** occur on doubles that succeed (00 is always critical), while **critical failures** happen on doubles that fail (99 is always critical) [1].

## Combat and Survival

Combat is **intentionally deadly** and should be avoided when possible. It uses opposed rolls—attackers roll Combat vs. defenders' Armor Save. Weapons deal significant damage, and characters can die quickly. The game encourages running, hiding, and clever solutions over direct confrontation [2].

**Health** is calculated as Strength × 2. When you reach 0 Health, make a Body Save—failure means death, success means unconsciousness with potentially permanent injuries. The game includes detailed rules for ammunition tracking, weapon ranges, and equipment degradation to emphasize resource scarcity [1].

**Stress and Panic** are central mechanics. You gain Stress from failing Saves, witnessing horrors, or enduring hardship. When you might panic, roll 2d10—if you roll equal to or under your current Stress, you panic and roll on the Panic table, which can result in anything from minor anxiety to complete psychological breakdown [1].

## Essential Game Concepts

**The Company** dominates the setting—a monolithic corporation with unlimited resources and no ethics. Players often work for The Company, which provides steady pay but treats them as disposable assets. Corporate horror is a major theme [2].

**Space is hostile**—the vacuum of space, equipment failures, and resource scarcity create constant tension. Oxygen, food, fuel, and ammunition must be carefully managed. Ships are expensive to maintain and repair [1].

**Horror follows the TOMBS cycle**: Transgression (awakening the horror), Omens (warning signs), Manifestation (the horror appears), Banishment (attempting to defeat it), and Slumber (temporary victory) [2].

**Experience and advancement** focus on survival—characters improve through surviving sessions, not killing monsters. Players can also improve through Shore Leave, cybernetic modifications, and acquiring wealth and influence [2].

This overview provides the foundation you need to start playing Mothership. The game emphasizes atmosphere and tension over complex mechanics, making it accessible while delivering genuine thrills and scares. Remember: in Mothership, survival itself is victory.
