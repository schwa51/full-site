# 🕯️ What is *The Dare*?

**The Dare** is a one-night, Halloween haunted-house scenario for *Call of Cthulhu* where you play kids on a reckless challenge to spend the night in a notorious old home. The neighborhood whispers, the storm rolls in, and the house is very much not empty. It’s a classic “face the dark” tale of dares, friendship, and the thin line between courage and survival.

## How Does It Play?

- **System & format:** *Call of Cthulhu 7e*, tuned for a tight contained story. You’ll use kid investigators and simple gear—clever choices and caution matter more than brute force. 
- **Tone & pacing:** **Haunted-house exploration** with mounting pressure: creaks in the walls, bad weather, and something that wants you to stay. Expect fear checks, hard choices, and momentum toward a final dash for dawn.

## Themes & Table Feel

- **Child-eye horror:** ordinary places turned hostile; being small in a big, uncaring house.  
- **Isolation & entrapment:** a storm, shuttered windows, and the sense that adults won’t help.  
- **Creeping dread over jump scares:** strange sounds, vermin, and the feeling of being watched.

## Why You Should Play

- **Perfect for Halloween:** contained, atmospheric, and easy to drop in for one night.  
- **Clear stakes:** make it to morning—or make a stand.  
- **Memorable roles:** playing kids invites bold, inventive problem-solving (and great table banter).
