# 🦇 The Count, the Castle, & the Curse

## Scenario
A storm rolls over a foreign land as your carriage stops before a looming castle. You remember the letter, the invitation, and then— teeth, and darkness. Now you’ve awakened inside the Count’s domain with the night pressing in and midnight drawing near.

---
## How Does It Play?

- **System & format:** _Shadowdark_—quick rulings, fast turns, and time/light pressure. Ideal with pre-gens or low-level PCs.
- **Tone & pacing:** Cat-and-mouse through a labyrinthine keep; exploration, stealth, and nerve measured against a **ticking clock**.

## Themes & Table Feel

- Gothic dread: crypts, mirrors, chapels, storm-lit battlements
- Temptation vs. survival; power offered at a cost
- Claustrophobia and the urgency of **before midnight**

---
## Why You Should Play

- **Strong mood, clear goal:** get out before the stroke of midnight
- **Rules that move:** swift, dangerous, decisive
- **Great for one night:** contained space, big atmosphere
