## **1. Docking Bay 2 (Starting Location)**

The dull thrum of recycled air greets the crew as they step through the airlock, accompanied by the metallic tang of processed atmosphere and industrial lubricants. The bay's harsh fluorescent lights cast everything in stark whites and deep shadows, while the constant background hum of life support systems creates an almost hypnotic drone. The cold metal flooring rings hollow under boots, echoing off the curved walls. Sonya approaches with measured steps, her voice cutting through the ambient noise as she authorizes docking procedures [1].

## **2. Workspace** 

Work boots clang against metal grating as voices echo through the cramped, utilitarian space. The acrid smell of industrial solvents mingles with stale human sweat and the ozone scent of electrical equipment. Ten sets of gear hang in orderly cubbies - overalls still carrying the mineral dust of the mines, flashlights with worn grips, and short-range radios crackling with occasional static. The massive generator rumbles in one corner like a mechanical heartbeat, its vibrations felt through the floor, while the computer terminal bleeps steadily, casting blue light across rows of scrolling data. The yawning pit to the mine shaft exhales cool, damp air that tastes of deep earth and metal [1].

## **3. Quarters**

The corridor to the sleeping quarters feels cramped, with low ceilings that seem to press down on visitors. Each small room carries the distinct scent of its occupant - Sonya's faint perfume mixed with coffee, Ashraf's collection of cheap plastic toys giving off that particular synthetic smell, Dana's sparse quarters carrying only the clean scent of industrial soap. Mike's old bunk sits cleaned out and eerily sterile, while the unused bunk has been converted to recreational space, still carrying the electrical warmth of gaming consoles and the slightly musty smell of old cushions [1].

## **4. Mess Hall**

The communal eating area echoes with the soft hum of the automated kitchen unit, punctuated by the occasional gurgle of the hydroponic systems. Prince the cat's presence is immediately noticeable - the soft sound of purring, the faint scent of cat fur, and food bowls that clink softly when touched. The hydroponic garden provides a welcome splash of green and the earthy, fresh smell of growing plants, though some leaves show worrying brown edges and the soil feels slightly dry to the touch. A cassette sits abandoned on the table, its plastic case slightly warm from the overhead lighting [1].

## **5. Washrooms**

The washrooms carry the echoing acoustics of tiled surfaces and running water, though one shower cubicle stands ominously silent. The broken shower shows signs of violent damage - twisted metal fixtures and shattered ceramic that crunches underfoot. The air carries the humid, slightly chlorinated smell of recycled water mixed with industrial cleaning products. The large extractor fan in the ceiling rattles occasionally, creating irregular breaks in the otherwise steady drip of water from functioning fixtures [1].

## **6. Mine Entrance**

The transition point where the station's artificial atmosphere meets the raw vacuum of space. Warning lights cast everything in alternating red and white, while the airlock seals hiss with pressurized gases. The smell of industrial rubber from vacuum suits mingles with the metallic bite of recycled air. Beyond the threshold, the automated drills create a constant grinding, scraping symphony that vibrates through the station's superstructure. The freight elevator creaks ominously, its cables singing with tension as it disappears into the black depths below [1].

## **7. Mine Tunnel**

The narrow shaft carries sound strangely - voices echo and distort while the constant drip of condensation creates an irregular percussion. Handheld lights reveal thin veins of ore glinting like metal tears in the black rock walls. The air tastes of mineral dust and something faintly organic. A careful search reveals a crack in the wall - just wide enough for a person to squeeze through, exhaling a strange, sweet smell that seems almost biological in nature [1].

## **8. Mine Depths**

Deep in the asteroid's heart, sound behaves differently - footsteps seem muffled while breathing sounds unnaturally loud. The walls here are natural cave formation, slick with condensation that reflects handheld lights in dancing patterns. A splash of yellow substance mars the wall, giving off a sweet, almost floral scent that's deeply unsettling. An empty vacuum suit slumps nearby, the fabric still carrying the lingering warmth of human habitation, while nearby, the word "SILENCE" is burned into the rock, the stone still radiating faint heat from the laser cutter that lies discarded, its metal surface cold to the touch [1].

## **9. Mine Antechamber**

The chamber opens into a natural cathedral of smooth black rock, its surfaces forming organic arches and whorls that seem almost deliberately crafted. The air here is thick and humid, carrying a sweet, cloying scent that coats the back of the throat. A fleshy pod in the wall weeps embryonic fluid with quiet, irregular dripping sounds. The yellow substance here is concentrated - thick pools that reflect light strangely and give off warmth that can be felt even at a distance. Scientific equipment hums quietly in one corner, its screens casting pale light across a scrap of paper bearing the numbers "0389" [1].

## **10. Research Ship Heracles - Docking Bay 1**

The keypad beeps softly as the correct code is entered, followed by the whisper-quiet hiss of an expensive airlock system. Inside, the ship's interior gleams with antiseptic cleanliness - white surfaces that reflect light without glare, and air that carries the faint ozone scent of advanced filtration systems. The washroom tells a different story - violence has left broken fixtures and twisted metal, with the sharp smell of cleaning chemicals unable to fully mask something more unsettling beneath.

In the science lab, equipment hums with quiet efficiency. The cassette recorder sits precisely positioned, its white cassette labeled in neat handwriting. Under the microscope, a specimen of yellow substance glistens like liquid amber, giving off that same sweet, biological scent.

And there stands Dr. Giovanni - silent, motionless, smiling. The soft sound of something wet can be heard even in the silence, and slowly, terribly, yellow fluid begins to leak from his mouth, carrying with it a smell like flowers left too long in water [1].
