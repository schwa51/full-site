## AGILITY SKILLS
**Force Sword:** A combat skill. Roll against this number when you attempt to whack someone with a force sword.  
**Grenade:** Another combat skill. When you hurt a grenade at something, roll against this to see if it goes where you want it. If you roll a 20, maybe you threw the pin instead of the grenade. Boom.  
**Neurowhip:** Another combat skill. Also a very nasty weapon.  
**Primitive Melee Weapon:** It is rumored (rumors are treason) that Outside there are people who, not having been exposed to the benefits of The Computer's benign instruction, are cave-man types and use antiquated weapons called knives, swords, clubs, and stuff like that. These weapons are rare in Alpha Complex, but sometimes Armed Forces personnel are trained to deal with them.  
**Truncheon:** IntSec's all-purpose weapon. Good for keeping Infrared scum in line.  
**Unarmed:** What you use if you don't have a force sword, neurowhip or truncheon lying around.

## CHUTZPAH SKILLS
Note that you can't use any of these skills (except Forgery) against other player characters.  
**Bootlicking:** How to ingratiate yourself with superiors.  
**Bribery:** A way to ingratiate yourself with almost anyone. By the way, using this skill is treasonous.  
**Con:** A way to persuade someone to let you do what you want when he probably oughtn't.  
**Fast Talk:** Like con, only you talk and move rapidly and hope to get away fast. If you "con" someone, he may never know he was zapped; if you fast talk him, he will, bur fast talking doesn't take as long.  
**Forgery:** Sometimes applying for those pesky termination vouchers through channels just isn't worth the hassle. Using this skill is treason, too.  
**Interrogation:** How to extract useful information from Commie mutant scum.  
**Intimidation:** This doesn't exactly ingratiate you with your inferior, but it does get their cooperation.  
**Motivation:** Leadership gets people heading in the right direction and even thinking it's a good idea.  
**Oratory:** How to get a bunch of people to do what you want.  
**Psychescan:** Basically, use this to try to figure out whether someone's lying or not.  
**Spurious Logic:** Con doesn't work with computers and bots, 'cause they're too logical. Instead, you have to build a completely logical construct on fallacious or incomplete assumptions to get them to do what you want.  
<br></br>

## DEXTERITY SKILLS
**Energy, Field, Laser and Projectile Weapons:** Skills that let you use different types of weapons. You also use these skills when your weapon breaks and you try to fix it.  
**Primitive Missile Weapons:** Like "primitive melee weapons," but applying to bows, arrows, rocks, beer bottles, and so on.  
**Vehicle Aimed, Field and Launched Weapons:** Skills that let you use weapons mounted on vehicles.  
<br></br>

## MECHANICAL SKILLS
**Habitat Engineering:** Knowledge of the air, communication, transport, power, water and waste systems in Alpha Complex. Mighty handy when you need to find a ventilation shaft to escape incoming fire.  
**Robot Operation and Maintenance:** These skills are broken down by robot type. Basically, they're how to use and repair bots.

<br></br>

## ENGINEERING SKILLS
**Biosciences:** How to produce mutant monstrosities in Alpha Complex's biolabs.
