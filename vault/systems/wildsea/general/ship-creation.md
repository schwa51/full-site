## Creating your Ship

Ship creation centers around spending stakes. Each crew starts with 6 stakes, then 3 additional stakes for each crew member. There are three stages to ship creation: deciding the **design**, adding **fittings**, and hiring the **undercrew**. When choosing these, keep in mind that every character should have a place on the ship to call their own. Every ship has a set of [ratings](/assets/pdfs/ship-ratings.pdf); tracks representing the ship’s condition and construction. Each of these ratings starts as a 1-track, but will gain more boxes as you spend your stakes on design, fittings, and undercrew choices. Full documentation [here](/assets/pdfs/ship-design.pdf). See a Ship Sheet [here](/assets/pdfs/wildsea-ship.pdf).

### Design
When spending your **stakes**, your group first needs to cover the basics of the ship’s design. Every ship needs to have at least one option chosen from the following sections…
- **Size**: A measure of how many crew and passengers a ship can comfortably hold.
- **Frame**: A ship’s basic profile and appearance.
- **Hull**: The main material used in a ship’s construction.
- **Bite**: The mechanism that lets a ship cut through (or otherwise traverse) the tangled waves of the Wildsea.
- **Engine**: The motive force behind the ship’s bite.  
<br>

### Fittings
Once the design is covered, you can add more specialized options to your ship in the form of fittings. Fittings choices are all optional, and come in the form of…
- **Motifs**: General themes you can choose for the ship, giving you basic equipment and alterations useful for certain common activities.
- **Additions**: Useful parts, resource-gathering options, and other oddities.
- **Rooms**: Quarters and workrooms for the crew.
- **Armaments**: Deck weapons used for defence against the hazards of the wild.
- **Outriders**: Smaller vessels with limited range that can be launched from the main ship.  
<br>

### Undercrew
The undercrew are NPC crewmembers loyal to the ship (or at least loyal to the percentage of spoils and profits they garner). Undercrew choices are entirely optional, and come in the form of…
- **Officers**: Named NPCs specializing in certain skills, languages, or aspects.
- **Gangs**: Small groups of unnamed NPCs that perform basic tasks during journeys.
- **Packs**: Creatures trained to aid, defend, or otherwise benefit the ship in some way.  
<br>

### Personal Touches
- **Colour and style**. What kind of patterns or artwork adorn your hull, and who painted or inscribed them there?
- **Shape and construction**. There are no hard rules on what shape your ship has to be, but having everyone at the table be on board with a rough layout can help in both roleplay and combat scenarios.
- **Quarters decoration**. Do you have your own little place on the ship, or do the crew sleep in a single room? What kind of personal effects do you keep in your quarters, and what do they mean to you?
- **Quirks**. There isn't a ship on the rustling waves that hasn't developed some sort of non-threatening fault or peculiarity that refuses to go away no matter how many times the crew tries to fix it.
- **History**. Where did your ship come from, and who crewed it before you? If it's a new vessel, how did you scrape together the resources needed to pay for it? Or perhaps you made it yourself - if so, where did you get the materials?
