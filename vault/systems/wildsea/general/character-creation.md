All characters in the Wildsea are a combination of three main elements - a bloodline, an origin, and a post. A **bloodline** sets your character’s species, letting the rest of the table know what you are in the most basic sense (especially physically). An **origin** determines how your character lived their early life, letting the rest of the table get a handle on the kind of culture you’re most used to. A **post** describes the kind of niche your character fills within the crew, the particular set of skills that make them valuable as a wildsailor. Character sheets are [here](/assets/pdfs/wildsea-character.pdf). A guide to names that might be found in the wildsea are [here](/assets/pdfs/wildsea-names.pdf).   
<br>

A **young gun** (bgeinning character) begins with…  
1 [Bloodline](/assets/pdfs/bloodline.pdf), 1 [Origin](/assets/pdfs/origin.pdf), and 1 [Post](/assets/pdfs/post.pdf)  
3 [Edges](/assets/pdfs/edges.pdf)  
8 [skill](/assets/pdfs/skills.pdf) or [language](/assets/pdfs/languages.pdf) ranks (maximum starting rank 2)  
4 [aspects](/assets/pdfs/aspects.pdf) taken from any bloodlines, origins, or posts  
4 [resources](/assets/pdfs/resources.pdf)  
3 [drives](/assets/pdfs/drives.pdf) and 3 [mires](/assets/pdfs/mires.pdf)  
<br>

The combination of your bloodline, origin and post is referred to as your [character's background](/assets/pdfs/character-overview.pdf). Your background can have a big influence on how your character interacts with the world, and how the world will treat them in turn. Some settlements may be easier to explore for characters of a particular bloodline (such as the high hanging buildings of tzelicrae cities), or the citizens wowed by someone with the talent to take a particular post (such as the innate respect a frontier town might pay to a hacker). Each choice you make carries with it a narrative risk and reward.    
<br>

### [What is an edge?](/assets/pdfs/edges.pdf)

Edges represent the way your character is most used to solving problems and tackling challenges, the approaches they’re usually the most effective with. When you attempt something using an edge you’re in your element - when rolling, you can **add 1d6 to your dice pool**.  
Edges also add a lot of narrative flavour to the rest of an action roll, changing the way a skill or aspect gets used in play. Rolling to gather specimens using the Tides edge might mean you’re focusing on quality, whereas rolling with Veils might let you gather those specimens without letting anyone else know, or without disturbing local wildlife.  
<br>

### [What are skills?](/assets/pdfs/skills.pdf)

Skills are areas in which your character has training or a natural advantage, making it more likely for you to succeed when taking related actions. Skills on the wildsea aren't quite as broadly applied as edges, but many can still be used in a wide variety of situations. Each of the skill write-ups gives you bullet-pointed examples of what they can be used for in-game, but these are by no means your limits - if you can think of a clever use of a skill that fi ts the situation, we encourage you to attempt it!
Each of your character’s skills has a rank, starting at one and topping out at three. When used as part of an action, **skills add a number of d6s to your dice pool equal to their rank**.
There are certain acts and actions on the wildsea that come up again and again due to the nature of the environment and the opportunities (or hazards) it presents. When creating a character in the next chapter, a set of quickstart kits will suggest useful skills as you go through the process, but the choice is ultimately yours.
When picking your skills, you should probably grab a few ranks in...
- Something that can be used to traverse an environment (such as Wavewalk, Vault, Outwit, or Delve)
- Something that can be used to survive (or fight) in a skirmish (such as Break, Hack, Hunt, Flourish, Brace, or Vault)
- Something to acquire resources (such as Hunt, Harvest, or Scavenge)
- Something to uncover information (such as Sway, Study, Outwit or Sense)

### [How do languages work?](/assets/pdfs/languages.pdf)

Like skills, languages you know are given ranks (from 1 to 3). Unlike skills, these ranks are named: **smattering**, **knowledge**, and **fluency**. You don't usually need to roll the dice to benefit from your language ranks - if you have a smattering of Saprekk, you'll be able to converse with others that speak it... to a degree. Here's a rough guide to what each rank means in terms of your overall ability.  
**Smattering**: Having a smattering of a language allows you to use and understand simple words and sentences without a problem. You can order food, chat about a few common wilds-related topics, and pronounce names with reasonable accuracy.  
**Knowledge**: Having knowledge of a language allows you to engage in normal conversation without a problem; you can discuss a wide range of topics, give opinions and directions, and easily follow conversations at the speed of a native speaker (even if you miss a word here or there).  
**Fluency**: Being fluent in a language shows you have complete mastery of it - you can read, write, listen, and speak without the fear of misunderstanding or being misunderstood.

Learning a language has a way of immersing you in the lore and culture surrounding it; a bundle of references, historical facts, and turns of phrase. This is what you'll likely roll your languages for most of the time - to draw on cultural knowledge and gain information.  
<br>

### [What is an Aspect?](/assets/pdfs/aspects.pdf)

Your aspects are the things that make your character distinct, giving them new abilities and unique ways to tackle challenges on the wildsea. You can have seven aspects in total (though most characters will begin play with four or six.
There are three types of aspect - **Traits**, **Gear** and **Companions**.
- **Traits** represent the benefits of training and experience, or the innate functions of your biology.
- **Gear** acts as a catch-all term for the weapons, armour, and tools that your character relies on.
- **Companions** can be anything from a trained animal to a construct, a living spell to a captured spirit; something that fights alongside you, acts as a mount, or scouts out places you wouldn’t normally be able to access.
<br>

### [What are resources?](/assets/pdfs/resources.pdf)

The wildsea is a scavenger’s paradise. Wrecks are taken apart for iron and machine parts, beasts provide meat and bone, and the waves themselves off er a bounty of fruits, fungi, and living secrets eager to burrow into active minds.
These are your resources - the useful oddities that your crew will collect during their travels. There are four broad categories - **salvage**, **specimens**, **whispers**, and **charts**.  
<br>

### [What are Mires?](/assets/pdfs/mires.pdf)

The wildsea takes its toll on those that sail it, bringing out more of their insecurities, phobias, and savage tendencies the longer they stray from port. These are your mires, the things that drag you down.
#### The Effects of Mire
As soon as one of your mire boxes is marked, it'll start having an effect on your character. Some of these are mechanical, tangible, defined - some of them are left more up to your interpretation.
#### Narrative Effects
If one box of a mire is marked, let hints of the condition bleed through into your roleplay. Perhaps you shy away from choices that would usually be easy, or bring the effects of the mire into a description of a related action.

If both boxes of a mire are marked, the mire should be at the forefront of your roleplay when possible, informing your choice of words and actions. Things you'd usually be able to do might be impossible, you may not be able to quell fears or vices, and the way you describe your actions to the other players should make it clear that your character is suffering.

#### Mechanical Effects

The effects of mire aren’t merely narrative either. Whenever you try to act in a way that contradicts a mire, you automatically **cut a number of dice** equal to the amount of marks on that mire track (such as trying to balance on a high branch with a mire marked that relates to instability or vertigo).  
<br>

### [What are Drives?](/assets/pdfs/drives.pdf)
Everyone at sea has goals they want to achieve, dreams to chase, and secrets to uncover. These are your drives, the goals that keep your character going - and making progress on these drives can pull your character out of even their darkest moods. Here are a few examples…
- Find my lost family
- Rid myself of the Karka parasite
- Discover and loot unexplored pre-verdant ruins
- Hunt and capture the Great White Wolf
- Decimate the Ripsong Marauders  
 
#### Using Your Drives
Whenever you achieve something that advances or satisfies one of your drives, you have a couple of options to choose from…
- **Gain a Whisper:** You gain a whisper that relates to the drive in some way, making it easier to tie that drive in to the narrative in the future.
- **Clear a Mark of Mire:** Immediately clear any one of the marked boxes on any of your mire tracks.
- **Gain a Minor Milestone:** Once per session you can add a minor milestone to your character sheet as the result of advancing one of your drives. Name the milestone something related to the drive in question.
- **Gain a Major Milestone:** Completely satisfying a drive can give a major milestone if you wish, but if it does you'll need to wipe that drive off of your sheet and choose a new one to replace it. When you gain a major milestone in this way, name it based on the drive that was satisfied. You can only do this once per session at most.

### [What are Milestones?](/assets/pdfs/milestones.pdf)
Milestones are narrative achievements that you can record on your character sheet to use as fuel for various **advancements**; extending the length of an aspect’s track, adding a rank in a skill or language, or even gaining a new aspect entirely. They’re split into two types, minor and major.  
Milestones represent things that are important for your character - whether an event is worth recording a milestone over is entirely your decision.
