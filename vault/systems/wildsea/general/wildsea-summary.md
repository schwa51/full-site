## What is the world of the Wildsea?


Three hundred years ago, the **Verdancy**, a wave of fast-growing trees and grasses and other flora, swept over the world from the West. Now the surface of the world is lost a mile below the trees, along with the civilizations, cultures and technologies that once were, pre-Verdency, or pre-V. Now travel is across the treetops, on waves of leaves and grass, with vessels powered by huge chainsaws. While there still remains some solid ground; the tops of mountains who’s former names are long-forgotten, many settlements exist on the trees themselves, on the giant **ironroots**, mile-high trees that are the foundation for the [sea of leaves](/assets/pdfs/layers.pdf). This rampant growth is driven by **crezzerin**, a potent toxin but also the source of massive growth and rapid mutation that has made the world anew. All come in contact with it briefly, but prolonged contact, like that out on the open sea, can warp both body and mind.

Given the loss of pre-V technology and resources, the current economy centers around bartering, favors, and acts of service. Salvage and recycling are key. This new world is full of weirdness and mystery. People are strange. Creatures are strange. Plants are strange. And then there are those who can twist that strangeness even more, bonding a creature and adopting abilities, inviting the storm in to replace your heart, calling the storm to drive your ship: this is the power of [**arconautics**](/assets/pdfs/arconautics.pdf).

## How does it play?

You take on the role of a **wildsailor**, part of a crew sailing these treetops, cutting across waves of leaves in ships propelled by chainsaw-drives running on honey or fruit or other strangeness, sailing between islands and settlements, avoiding wild beasts and wild survivors, hunting relics and salvage and whispers and rumor.

Mechanically you role **pools of d6 dice,** drawing on your character’s unique attributes to add or subtract to the pool. **Tracks** work as a kind of clock, counting down or up toward anything from a glorious storm of butterflies, magnificent to behold, to the breaking of the chain drive when you push your ship to hard.

Collecting **resources** helps your crew survive and your character progress, all while pushing the story forward as a conversation between players and the GM, **the Firefly**.

## How do I interpret the world of the Wildsea?  

What is this world? How do I see it? Imagine a world not unlike our own (but not ours) with its own history and timeline.  

### Technology  
They had tools and fire and the wheel. They had agriculture. They had sailing and advanced metallurgy. They had gunpowder and the compass, mechanical clocks and printing. They had engines to power boats and vehicles across the land. All of these things would be mostly identifiable to the peoples of the Wildsea. They had electricity and the radio. They likely had airplanes or either airborne travel. These would also be identifiable by some.  
They may have had advanced physics, including nuclear power, spaceflight, computers, the internet, advanced medical treatments such as antibiotics, vaccines, etc. These things would not be recognized, except maybe by an expert with years of study and even then, they would probably not really understand it well.  
### The Verdancy  
300 years ago, this society completely collapsed in a wash of trees. Most people died. All existing society and social orders were gone. Scattered groups survived, but no one was unchanged. Nearly everything was forgotten. The crezzerin drove rapid growth, but also rapid mutation. Other life was elevated to the realm of reason. Cacti, fungi, spiders, moths; even the detritus of vessels and machines, imbued with purpose and drive from their crews and operators, were given life. That drive, that will, that desire that moves you, also can take on life after the body dies as the anchored.  
### Whispers  
This is a world full of life- even ideas can come alive. “Words with souls”, whispers are thoughts that literally change the world when spoken. They can be used to discover secrets, spinning the world in your favor for a moment. For example, the whisper “Sparks on the breeze” may be spoken quietly to blow flickers of light into a dark room, or shouted loud to start a fire. They can be caught and traded, studied, but are almost always lost when spoken.  
### Arconautics. 
Sometimes this life-giving power can be controlled. For brief moments. With hours upon hours of training. This is arconautics. It is harnessing the power of the natural world around you, and shaping it to your needs. Bonding a creature with chameleon-like skin and adopting that power. Shaping the bones of a leviathan into an almost self-aware grappling hook. Harness that life-giving power directly and surviving a lightning strike. Extracting the lighter-than-air property of the floating Fallcup flower to imbue a deck mounted cannon making it feel no heavier than a book. The gulf between the potential to do a thing and being able to do it reliably and when need is vast and requires years of training and is dangerous and unpredictable enough that most inhabitants of the Wildsea have only heard of arconautics or witness minor feats. Masters of the craft exist, but are rare and tend to avoid calling undue attention to themselves. As in most worlds, there is significant fear of the strange and novel.
