# What is *The Wildsea*?

**The Wildsea** is a narrative-forward RPG of wild exploration, post-apocalyptic overgrowth, and strange cultures. Sail atop the treetop canopy of a vast, world-spanning jungle aboard living ships.

This is a game about:
- **Weird voyages** on chainsaw-driven ships cutting through treetops a mile high
- **Personal stories** of growth, scars, and strange discoveries
- **A world reclaimed by nature**, teeming with fungus, insect swarms, and forgotten relics
- **Improv-rich narration** and flavorful fiction-first play

## How Does It Play?

**The Wildsea** uses a custom narrative engine built on:
- **Multiple d6s**: Roll a handful and keep the best result. Traits, skills, and gear all feed into your dice pool.
- **Narrative resolution**: No strict initiative—players narrate risks, rolls determine tone (triumph, success, twist, failure).
- **Drives and scars**: Characters evolve through trauma, discovery, and inner conflict.
- **Collaborative worldbuilding**: Setting is created at the table, guided by poetic prompts and vivid descriptors.

## Ships, Factions, and the Green Sea

Players belong to a motley crew of:
- **Half-plant, half-human hybrids**, sentient fungi, symbiotic wanderers
- **Sky-sailors and hedge-scouts** who brave dangers from seedstorms to tree leviathans
- **Living ships** that groan and dream as they slice through tangle and vine

The Wildsea offers:
- **Factions and cults**, each with deep beliefs and weird tech
- **Journeys over destinations**, where the stories bloom along the way
