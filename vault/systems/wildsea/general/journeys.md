Journeys are how we travel in the Wildsea and are usually undertaken by ship. They are both a narrative piece of the game, but also have a specific rule structure guiding our progress and events that occur along the way.
  
  
First, each ship has a set of ratings that will be used to build the dice pool. While your ship will have six ratings total, we’ll only use one at a time for a ratings roll. The dice pool is built by grabbing a die for each unmarked box on the rating track. These start as 1 box and depending on how you outfit your ship, you add more boxes. If something is damaged on the ships, you’d mark a box on a relevant track, reducing your dice pool for that rating. Once you’ve built the dice pool, roll the dice and take the highest result and check against the table below:

| Roll      | Result                                                                                                                                       |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 6         | **Triumph:** You bypass the obstacle safely.                                                                                                 |
| 5 or 4    | **Conflict:** You bypass the obstacle, but take a mark of damage to the rating.                                                              |
| 3, 2 or 1 | **Disaster:** You fail to bypass the obstacle and also take damage to the rating.                                                            |
| Doubles   | **Twist:** An unexpected event in addition tot eh usual result that might involve the ship, the crew or the environment you’re traveling in. |
  

The three parts of a Journey are **Departure**, **Progress**, and **Arrival**.
  

**Departure** is the preparation for the journey- gather last minute things to prep the ship, set the stations, describe the route.
  

**Progress** is the heart of the Journey. The two main actions are **At the Helm** and **On Watch**. 
  

The player at the helm controls the ship and can choose safety- _Cut a Path_, which allows you to mark a box of progress and avoid any watch results. They can also choose a little more risk with _Forge Ahead_, which lets you mark two progress boxes but you’ll also probably run right into anything encountered on watch. Finally, you can also _Drop Anchor_ and rest and repair.
  

The player on watch can spend resources to make a discovery or make a watch roll. A watch roll has 3 general options: a 6 gives you a danger-free opportunity at something, a 4 or 5 is usually an encounter with danger and reward while a 1, 2 or 3 indicates danger with little to now reward.
  

To make a discovery instead, you would choose to spend a chart and a whisper to create an encounter. This is described in more detail in the attached files and is largely a discussion amongst the group as to what this will be, with the Firefly having final say.
  

Finally **Arrival**. Once the final box of the progress track is filled, the journey is complete and you’ve arrived at your destination. Often the first things to address are basic needs including healing, relaxation to clear mire, and repairing the ship.
