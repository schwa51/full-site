Seuf Ohm, a Ketra Anchored Tempest. Edges in Grace, Sharps and Tides. +2 in Delve and Rattle. + 1 in Sense and Study. +3 in Low Sour and Chthonic. +2 in Highvin. Aspects of Gelatinous, bolt-switch, Geist hand, and lightning calls. Has salvage of a diver’s helmet and a broken lightning rod (his anchor). Has a chart of a faded map showing where his sapience originated and has a whisper of “The calm before”. Has drives to avert a disaster by causing another disaster, raise a Pre-V structure and to find the origin of his lightning rod. Has mires of Sparks pinwheel from me as I move, I’m obsessed with storms, and I cannot control the ink blots on my skin.
