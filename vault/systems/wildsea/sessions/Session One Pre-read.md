## Dramatis Loci: The Spit

**North Delginli Spit** is a fairly large spit, formed of two old ships, no longer wave-worthy, now fastened together and anchored in the tangle and sitting in the thrash. <u>This is home, or at least has become home.</u> It’s a crowded place but mostly peaceful. Long a quiet backwater, known for quality salvaging but not much else, it’s location next to the newly opened rift has been both a blessing and a curse. The increase in goods and patrons has been a boon, but it's hard for a small settlement to welcome strangers.  
Given the dangerous nature of the wildsea, most of the buildings and rooms are covered and built under the main deck of the ship. Up on the main deck is **Haraka’s Moorage**, taking up most of the deck space of one of the ships, with 2 large cranes and a fairly large workshop. Most of the rest of the deck space is given to farming.  
On the first level of the spit are the market, **Kiko’s,** and the main entrance to **Spindlewood Pasture**, which actually spreads across both the 1st and 2nd levels. The rest of the 2nd level is mostly private rooms. There are frequent holes in the walls of the ship allow passage out into the thrash. There are pathways and such wandering through the thrash and looping around the sides of the ships.  
<br>

**Haraka’s Moorage:** Shipyard & Dock- a place for ship repairs, refitting, finding local sailing knowledge, etc.  

**Kiko’s:** Chop Shop (restaurant)- a place for good food!  

**Hanonan Market**- the center of barter and trade in the settlement. A loose collection of stalls and carts where people gather to trade.   

**Spindlewood Pasture:** Junction (imagine an old tavern/inn)- the social heart of the Spit.

### Local organizations:
**The Gulpers-** a group of local Gau obsessed with exotic fruit. They have lavish tastes and are always on the hunt for rare specimens they can cultivate and grow (to eat).  
**The Twisted Couriers-** run messages in the local vicinity. This part of the Wildsea is near a rift, with lots of temporary habitations popping up. The Couriers charge a premium for their services, but are fast and very reliable.  
**The Mouldering Ones** (they don’t call themselves this- they just refer to themselves as “the bound”, which annoys other Ironbound to no end)- a local Ironbound group/club. They are content with their lot in life- they have a tendency to reminisce about their time as ships/equipment/etc, (all while having a very poor memory of that time), and like to tell stories (nearly all fictional) about their escapades.  
**Red Hackers-** the go-to local hacker org. If you need a difficult trail set, or a ship pulled out, etc, these guys are who you hire.  
**The Golden Host of Gertrude the Vast-** the crew of a large salvage ship, Gertrude the Vast, known affectionately by her crew as “the prettiest lass on the Wildsea”, but by everyone else as “Gertrude the Grotesque” and “that thing actually floats?!” or “how has that not keeled over yet?” and “I’ve never seen an uglier ship”. They pride themselves on the salvage they bring in, but even the locals who tend to be supportive suspect these guys are operating with a few missing deck planks. They are a newer operation since the opening of the rift, made up mostly of locals looking for a big score.  
**Chut’s Flotilla-** A more experienced salvage operation that’s been based in North Delginli Spit forever. Mainly camped out on Lavish Slough right now, though they do have a rotation of agents hanging out back at the Spit, managing affairs.

## Dramatis Loci: The near country

**Root Knuckle Rift**, a large opening in the canopy of the wildsea, opened up a little over two months ago after the fall of a mile-high Ironroot, leaving a gaping hole in the sea. Since that time, as word has spread, there have been sloughs and reefs and other small temporary settlements popping up as salvagers, explorers and other people drawn to the rift for a risky chance valuable pre-verdant salvage might wash up from the depths. The wildsea is unsettled after the Ironroot fall, with rootquakes occuring with some frequency, making navigation difficult. With the influx of salvagers, small camps are popping up. The most permanent of these nearby locales is **Lavish Slough**, about two day’s hard-sailing away. This is where **Chut’s Flotilla** has their main camp. Otherwise there are some smaller temporary camps and such, but not much else.

## Dramatis Loci: The wider world

Much of the Wildsea is as it sounds, a wild place, with little to no organization or overarching rule. It is a place of isolated settlements that are often short-lived by nature of the mutability of the Wildsea. This is a world that is hard to tame. However, there exist a few areas with a known identity and location, known as Reaches.  

What is a **Reach**? It’s an area of the Wildsea defined by a little more cohesion. Often this is due to geography, but sometimes by climate or other factors.. Some known or rumored places include:  

**The Conflagration**- Nobody quite remembers which of the region’s warring factions set the fire, but everybody knows the result. An inferno, still burning after two hundred years. A scar of smoke on the sky. It lies to the north.  

**The Interregnum**- a place of towering evergreens overshadowed by endless winter full of ice and snow. It lies far to the north, beyond The Conflagration.  

**The Icterine**- a dry desert place where improbable mile-high cacti make up the wavescape. It lies to the east.  

**The Foxloft**- a reach of hybrid oaks, devoted hunters and various fox-like creatures, centered around The Seven Walls, towering pre-verdant constructions that are just visible in the uppermost parts of the tangle. It lies to the south.
