## What the Fellowship Knows About Goewen
***
#### **Elf of Lindon**

_The Elves of Lindon are among the last High Elves to dwell in Middle-earth, having once lived in the blessed lands beyond the Sea. They carry with them the wisdom, sorrow, and beauty of ages past. Though many have departed, those who remain in Lindon are stewards of ancient memory, artisans of exquisite skill, and watchers against the Shadow. To meet one is to glimpse the twilight of an elder world._

Goewen is known among the Fellowship as a quiet, thoughtful presence—an Elf who rarely speaks of her past but often offers insight from her time in a distant trading town. She has shared small details: her love of research, stories of people she encountered in her village, and hints of her family. She’s often seen as curious, scholarly, and gentle, but there is an unspoken sense that she has kept much of her deeper story private.  
  
The others may suspect that she left her home not entirely by choice. Her phrasing—always framed as a desire to “learn more about other species”—feels practiced, and there’s a sense that something in her past didn’t quite fit with the world she left behind. They may wonder if she didn’t belong.  
  
Among the Company, Goewen has quietly earned a reputation. She doesn’t chase gold or fame. She helps people without asking for anything in return. Her demeanor is calm and sometimes detached, which to some makes her seem a little odd. But those who travel with her have come to understand that beneath her stillness is a steadfast ally—one who will always have their back when it matters most.  
  
No nicknames have stuck to her yet, but there’s no doubt that Goewen is remembered. Not for what she says, but for what she does—and for the quiet loyalty she offers those she calls friend.
