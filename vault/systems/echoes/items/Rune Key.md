## Summary
A key found by a traveling trader [[Eledan Thornfoot full]] in old stone ruins south of Bree.

## Physical Description
A hexagonal tablet forged of ancient mithril, with what appear to be faint lines of mithril. It is quite ancient. It is clearly dwarven made given the exquisite craftmanship, but here is something notable about it- the forging is exceedingly fine for a key, even if it were a key to treasured cache. There is an air of beauty not typical found in such works.
On the reverse there is a complex mechanical notch patter, crafted to fit a dwarven lock. It is suspended on a woven chain of steel and twisted copper.

## Known Properties

- old

## Historical Origins
Reportedly found buried beneath some stones in an old stone ruins south of Bree off the Greenway.
