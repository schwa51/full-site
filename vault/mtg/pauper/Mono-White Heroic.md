This is an aggressive mono‑white aura deck that goes tall on a single **heroic** creature, then protects it while gaining a ton of life and damage through stacked auras and protection effects.

## Game plan overview

- Lead with a cheap hero like **Lagonna‑Band Trailblazer** or **Akroan Skyguard**, then start targeting it with auras and tricks to grow it out of burn and combat range.
- Use cheap enchantments (**Ethereal Armor**, **Hyena Umbra**, **Sentinel’s Eyes**, **Homestead Courage**) to both pump your threat and increase your total enchantment count, making Armor hit extremely hard.
- Keep up protection and resilience with **Benevolent Blessing**, **Mask of Law and Grace**, **Shield of Duty and Reason**, and **Emerge Unscathed** so your suited‑up creature survives spot removal and blockers.

## Core lines and key threats

- Ideal start is turn one **Lagonna‑Band Trailblazer**, turn two aura (often **Hyena Umbra** or **Sentinel’s Eyes**), then follow with **Ethereal Armor** and more auras so you attack with a massive, first‑strike wall that races any aggro deck.
- **Akroan Skyguard** is your evasive closer; every spell you cast on it makes it permanently bigger and gives you a flying clock that ends games in just a few swings once loaded with Armor.
- **Skyward Spider** lets you diversify threats and gives reach/flying defense; it becomes another excellent Armor carrier and helps against decks that try to race in the air.

## Protection, lifegain, and resilience

- **Hyena Umbra**’s totem armor protects your key creature from removal or combat, while **Benevolent Blessing**, **Mask of Law and Grace**, and **Shield of Duty and Reason** give protection from colors to blank removal, blockers, and edicts.
- **Spirit Link** and **Lifelink** (plus naturally lifelinking Sacred Cat) turn your giant attacker into a huge life‑gain engine, making it almost impossible for Burn or aggro to race.
- **Homestead Courage** and **Sentinel’s Eyes** provide vigilance and recursive value from the graveyard, letting your creature both attack and stay back on defense while repeatedly growing from heroic triggers.

## Mulligans and sequencing tips

- Keep hands with: at least two Plains, one hero (Trailblazer/Skyguard), and at least one pump aura plus either protection or more card advantage from flashback/escape (Courage/Eyes). Hands with all auras but no good body are weaker.
- Lead with **Trailblazer** against red and removal‑heavy decks (naturally high toughness), and with **Skyguard** when you expect creature stalls or need evasion.
- Often it is correct to hold **Benevolent Blessing** or **Emerge Unscathed** until you can respond to removal; once your creature is huge, play around sweepers and edicts by having a backup body (Doomed Traveler, Sacred Cat) on the board.

## Sideboard roles (from list given)

- **Mask of Law and Grace** and **Shield of Duty and Reason**: Extra main‑deckable hate vs specific colors (red/black removal, blue tempo), making it extremely hard for those decks to interact profitably.
- **Thraben Charm**: Flexible removal/hate piece—can handle problematic creatures, graveyards, or permanents depending on the mode, giving you game against a wide range of strategies without diluting your enchantment count too much.
