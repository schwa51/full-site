This is a fast mono‑green aggro deck that curves out cheap creatures, then uses efficient pump and protection spells to push through big damage with evasive threats like **Silhana Ledgewalker** and **Skarrgan Pit‑Skulk**.

## Links
- [Decklist]({{ mtg.decklist_url }})

## Game plan overview

- Lead with one-drops and two-drops: **Nettle Sentinel**, **Skarrgan Pit‑Skulk**, **Vault Skirge**, **Nest Invader**, and **Burning‑Tree Emissary** let you apply pressure while often double‑spelling early turns.[4][5][1]
- Stick a good threat and start suiting it up with **Rancor**, **Elephant Guide**, and **Hunger of the Howlpack**, turning even small bodies into huge attackers that are hard to block.[2][6][1]
- Use **Vines of Vastwood** and **Savage Swipe** to both clear blockers and protect your best creature, keeping your clock intact through interaction.[7][8][1]

## Key threats and synergies

- **Silhana Ledgewalker** is your premier closer: pseudo‑hexproof plus evasion makes it ideal to carry Rancor, Elephant Guide, and big Hunger counters; many decks simply cannot block it meaningfully.[9][1][2]
- **Skarrgan Pit‑Skulk** becomes a nightmare once bloodthirst is on; its “can’t be blocked by smaller creatures” text pairs extremely well with pump spells to punch through stalled boards.[3][1][2]
- **Vault Skirge** gives you lifelink and evasion, turning any pump spell into a huge life swing that helps you race Burn and other fast aggro decks.[6][1][2]

## Pump, protection, and interaction

- **Rancor** is the core of the deck: repeatable trample and power boost that lets you pressure planeswalkers‑style life totals even through chump blockers.[1][3][6]
- **Hunger of the Howlpack** offers massive permanent growth when morbid is on; you often punish removal or favorable trades by stacking three counters on an unblocked attacker.[10][2][1]
- **Vines of Vastwood** and **Savage Swipe** act as both combat tricks and removal: Vines protects against spot removal while often adding lethal damage, and Swipe lets your cheap creatures fight down larger blockers.[7][9][1]

## Mulligans and sequencing tips

- Keep hands with: at least one Forest, an early threat (Nettle, Pit‑Skulk, Skirge, Nest Invader), and at least one pump/protection spell (Rancor, Hunger, Vines). Hands that are all tricks with no creatures are unplayable.[11][3][1]
- Try to enable bloodthirst on **Skarrgan Pit‑Skulk**—often by playing it post‑combat—so it enters with a counter and is harder to block profitably.[2][3][1]
- Use **Quirion Ranger** to pick up a Forest and replay it or to untap a key attacker for **Savage Swipe** or a surprise block; it also lets you represent tricks while still developing your board.[5][4][1]

## Sideboard roles (from list given)

- **Gleeful Sabotage** and **Natural State**: Bring in versus Affinity, auras, and other key artifacts/enchantments; Sabotage’s conspire often gets you a two‑for‑one.[3][1][2]
- **Gut Shot** and **Scattershot Archer**: Cheap or free answers to small fliers and X/1s (Faeries, tokens, Delvers) that otherwise race you in the air.[9][1][3]
- **Viridian Longbow**: Equipment that turns your random creatures into pingers; great in grindy matchups and against decks full of small utility creatures.[1][2]
- **Relic of Progenitus** and **Weather the Storm**: Relic fights graveyard decks and recursion, while Weather the Storm buys you big chunks of life against Burn and other spell-dense strategies.[3][1]
