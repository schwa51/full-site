This deck is a green-based defender combo deck that makes effectively infinite mana with **Axebane Guardian** or **Overgrown Battlement**, then converts that mana into a kill with **Valakut Invoker**, **Secret Door**, or **Tuktuk Rubblefort** plus a giant board of creatures.

## Game plan overview

- Develop your board with cheap defenders and mana creatures: **Saruli Caretaker**, **Overgrown Battlement**, **Axebane Guardian**, **Jaspera Sentinel**, and **Orochi Leafcaller** ramp you quickly while blocking early pressure.
- Use **Quirion Ranger** and **Tinder Wall** to accelerate into multiple spells a turn, and cast card selection like **Winding Way** and **Lead the Stampede** to refill on creatures and find missing combo pieces.
- The midgame goal is to assemble several defenders plus either an untap engine (**Freed from the Real** or **Galvanic Alchemist**) or a tutor (**Drift of Phantasms**, **Shield-Wall Sentinel**) so you can set up your infinite-mana turn.

## Primary combo lines

- Infinite mana line 1 – Axebane + untap: With **Axebane Guardian** and at least one other defender, you can make multiple mana, then use **Freed from the Real** or soulbonded **Galvanic Alchemist** to untap it and repeat, generating effectively infinite colored mana.
- Infinite mana line 2 – Battlement + filter: **Overgrown Battlement** works similarly, but only makes green, so you often pair it with **Orochi Leafcaller** to turn that green into blue (for Freed/Alchemist) or red (for Invoker) while looping untaps.
- Converting to a win: Once you have absurd or infinite mana, you win by repeatedly activating **Valakut Invoker** to deal 3 damage per activation, by pumping **Secret Door** to venture through the dungeon, or by using **Tuktuk Rubblefort** to give your team haste so an army of walls can suddenly attack for lethal.

## Tutors and card advantage

- **Drift of Phantasms** is both an on-board defender and a key tutor: you can transmute it to find **Freed from the Real**, **Axebane Guardian**, **Overgrown Battlement**, or **Valakut Invoker** depending on what you are missing.
- **Shield-Wall Sentinel** chains through your defender package, finding **Axebane Guardian**, **Secret Door**, or other walls to finish assembling the combo.
- **Lead the Stampede** and **Winding Way** are your gas, commonly drawing 2–4 creatures at a time and letting you rebuild after removal or dig for the exact wall/untap piece you need.

## Mulligans and sequencing tips

- Keep hands with at least two early mana sources (any combination of land, Caretaker, Sentinel, Ranger, or Tinder Wall) plus a payoff or way to find one (Drift, Shield-Wall, Lead, Winding Way). Pure interaction-light, one-lander hands without acceleration are risky.
- Prioritize getting **Axebane Guardian** or **Overgrown Battlement** down as soon as reasonably safe, then follow up with more defenders so your untap cards produce large bursts of mana immediately.
- Often you want to hold **Freed from the Real** or **Galvanic Alchemist** until you can go off in the same turn, to minimize exposure to removal on your enchanted/soulbonded wall.

## Sideboard roles

- **Coalition Honor Guard**: Protects your key creatures from targeted removal and edicts by forcing opposing spells and abilities to target it instead.
- **Mesmeric Fiend**: Disruption against control and combo; clears counterspells or sweepers before you commit to the combo turn.
- **Faerie Macabre**: Free, instant-speed graveyard hate versus reanimator, TortEx, or other graveyard-centric strategies.
- **Spore Frog** and **Tamiyo’s Safekeeping**: Spore Frog buys repeated “Fog” turns while you set up, and Safekeeping protects Axebane/Battlement from removal while padding your life total.
