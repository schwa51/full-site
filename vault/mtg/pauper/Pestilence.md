This is a slow, grindy Orzhov control deck that stabilizes the board with removal and life‑gain, then locks up the game using **Pestilence** plus hard‑to‑kill creatures like **Guardian of the Guildpact**.

## Game plan overview

- Early turns are about surviving and fixing mana: play tapped lands (**Scoured Barrens**, **Kabira Crossroads**, **Orzhov Basilica**) and cheap blockers like **Thraben Inspector** and **Lone Missionary** while killing key threats with **Cast Down**, **Chainer’s Edict**, and **Journey to Nowhere**.
- Generate incremental advantage with **Spare Supplies**, **Kor Skyfisher**, and life‑gain creatures so you keep drawing extra cards and padding your life total.
- Once the board is stable, land **Pestilence** and a resilient body (ideally **Guardian of the Guildpact**) and start sweeping away creatures while slowly draining your opponent.

## Engines and finishers

- **Pestilence** is both your board wipe and win condition; with enough life and a surviving creature, you can repeatedly activate it to keep the battlefield empty and chip away at your opponent’s life total.
- **Guardian of the Guildpact** dodges most removal and survives Pestilence activations because it has protection from monocolored, making it the perfect partner to close out games while you repeatedly sweep.
- **Palace Sentinels** gives you the monarch in slower matchups, turning every turn cycle into an extra card and forcing opponents to overextend into your removal and Pestilence.

## Value loops and card advantage

- **Thraben Inspector** and **Spare Supplies** provide cheap artifacts you can rebuy with **Kor Skyfisher** for repeated card draw and early blocking.
- **Lone Missionary** and life‑gain lands let you repeatedly gain life when bounced by Skyfisher, fueling larger Pestilence activations and stabilizing against Burn.
- **Omen of the Dead** buys back key creatures (Guardian, Skyfisher, Missionary); in longer games, Skyfisher plus Omen can form a soft loop of threats and value.

## Removal and disruption

- **Cast Down**, **Journey to Nowhere**, and **Chainer’s Edict** are your main answers to individual creatures, while **Suffocating Fumes** and Pestilence clean up go‑wide boards.
- **Castigate** and **Duress** (main and side) pick apart control and combo opponents by stripping key spells before they resolve.
- **Bojuka Bog** and sideboard **Nihil Spellbomb** give you strong, maindeck‑friendly graveyard hate versus Terror, Tron, and recursion decks.

## Mulligans and sequencing tips

- Keep hands with: at least two lands (ideally one untapped), an early play (Inspector/Missionary or cheap removal), and access to both colors by turn two or three; pure tap‑land hands with no interaction are risky.
- Try to resolve **Pestilence** only when you can immediately activate it for value and have a creature that will stick around (Guardian, a large Gurmag Angler, or multiple bodies plus high life total).
- Sequence **Kor Skyfisher** after you’ve played value permanents (Spare Supplies, Inspector, Kabira Crossroads) so every bounce feels like drawing a card or gaining more life.

## Sideboard roles

- Extra **Cast Down**, **Chainer’s Edict**, **Debt to the Kami**: Bring in vs big creatures and midrange; Debt also hits enchantments or small boards of key threats.
- **Prismatic Strands**: Excellent against aggro and Burn; can completely blank a combat step or burn turn, often twice thanks to flashback.
- **Revoke Existence**, **Leave No Trace**: For Affinity, Bogles, and other artifact/enchantment-heavy decks; Leave No Trace can be a blowout against multiple auras.
- **Nihil Spellbomb** and extra **Duress/Castigate**: Graveyard hate plus extra hand disruption versus Tron, Terror, and combo/control shells.
