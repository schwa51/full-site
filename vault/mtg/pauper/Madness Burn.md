This is an aggressive Rakdos spell deck that uses discard outlets to cast **madness** burn spells for cheap, gaining big tempo swings with **Kitchen Imp**, **Fiery Temper**, and **Alms of the Vein** while chipping in with small creatures and incidental life drain.[1][2][3]

## Game plan overview

- Deploy early pressure with **Voldaren Epicure**, **Kitchen Imp**, and **Sneaky Snacker**, using blood tokens and looting effects to start discarding cards profitably.[2][4][1]
- Use **Faithless Looting** and **Grab the Prize** as your primary enablers, turning discard into value by casting **Fiery Temper** and **Alms of the Vein** for their madness costs at instant speed.[5][1][2]
- While you’re burning them out, incidentally drain with **Vampire’s Kiss** and **Highway Robbery**, which both add blood tokens and life swings that help you race.[4][1][2]

## Core madness lines

- Classic line: turn one **Voldaren Epicure**, turn two **Faithless Looting** discarding **Kitchen Imp** and **Fiery Temper**; you cast both for madness, getting a 2/2 flying haste and 3 damage for only a couple of mana.[6][1][2]
- **Highway Robbery** shines in midgame: you drain 2, make a blood token, and set up future turns where that blood token discards a madness card (Alms/Temper/Imp) for another cheap spell.[7][8][1]
- **Sneaky Snacker** gives you repeatable discard at instant speed; you can end-step activate it to pitch a madness card, cast it right away, and then eventually get Snacker back to your hand for more value.[9][10][1]

## Burn and disruption

- Your main burn suite is **Lightning Bolt**, **Fiery Temper**, and **Alms of the Vein**; use them early to control creatures, then pivot to the opponent’s face once they are in the 10–12 life range.[11][1][2]
- **Highway Robbery** and **Vampire’s Kiss** add reach and life gain, making it very hard for aggressive decks to win damage races against you.[1][2][4]
- Sideboard cards like **Duress**, **Extract a Confession**, **Contaminated Ground**, and **Cast into the Fire** let you interact with control, big creatures, Tron, and artifacts without diluting your core burn plan too much.[2][5][1]

## Mulligans and sequencing tips

- Keep hands with: at least two lands, a discard outlet (**Faithless Looting**, blood from Epicure/Robbery), and at least one madness payoff (Kitchen Imp, Fiery Temper, Alms). Hands full of fair-costed spells without enablers are much worse.[3][1][2]
- Try to sequence Looting when you can immediately pay for at least one madness card; this turns Looting into both card selection and a free spell, which is how you get ahead on tempo.[5][1][2]
- Treat **Jagged Barrens** as a small burn spell—its life-loss on entry matters—so plan your curve with it in mind and avoid bottlenecking yourself on tapped lands when you want to double-spell.[4][1][2]

## Sideboard roles (from list given)

- **Faerie Macabre** and **Nihil Spellbomb**: Instant-speed graveyard hate for Terror, Tron, and graveyard combo, while Spellbomb cantrip keeps your engine flowing.[1][2]
- **Red Elemental Blast**: Bring in against blue control and tempo to force through Looting/Grab the Prize and protect key madness spells from counters.[11][2][1]
- **End the Festivities** and **Cast into the Fire**: Sweep small creature boards and answer artifacts; excellent versus go-wide aggro and Affinity-style decks.[2][5][1]
