This deck is a creature-based combo deck that uses landcyclers and walls to pull all basics out of your library, then mills itself with **Balustrade Spy** and wins on the spot with **Dread Return** into **Lotleth Giant** or a massive **Haunting Misery**.[1][2][3]

## Game plan overview

- Develop early by cycling **Generous Ent**, **Sagu Wildling**, and **Troll of Khazad-dûm** to find Forest/Swamp, and by casting cheap defenders like **Overgrown Battlement**, **Saruli Caretaker**, **Wall of Roots**, and **Gatecreeper Vine** to fix and ramp. These creatures both buy time and stock the battlefield for later Dread Return sacrifices.[2][1]
- Use **Land Grant**, **Gatecreeper Vine**, and landcycling to ensure that after a few turns all basic lands are out of your library so that Spy will mill your entire deck when it resolves.[4][1][2]
- While doing this, dig for combo pieces with **Elven Farsight**, **Lead the Stampede**, and **Winding Way**, always prioritizing having: enough lands in play, a Spy to cast, and at least one **Dread Return** plus win condition (Lotleth Giant / Haunting Misery) still in the library.[1][2]

## Primary combo line

- Step 1 – Set up: Get to at least four mana, usually with multiple walls in play, and empty your library of Forests and Swamps using landcyclers and tutors. Try not to cast Winding Way in a way that strands both **Lotleth Giants** in your hand, since you want at least one in the deck to reanimate.[2][1]
- Step 2 – Spy turn: Cast **Balustrade Spy** targeting yourself; with no lands left in your library it mills your whole deck.[3][1][2]
- Step 3 – Dread Return: After milling, flash back **Dread Return** by sacrificing three creatures (typically walls and random bodies) to reanimate **Lotleth Giant**, draining the opponent for your total creature count in graveyard, which is usually lethal. If it is not, a second Dread Return or a follow-up **Haunting Misery** from the yard can finish the job.[5][1][2]

## Backup plans and alternate wins

- **Haunting Misery** gives you an angle against life-gain or graveyard interaction: after self-mill, you can exile creatures from your graveyard to deal the last points of damage even if Dread Return or Giant are disrupted.[6][5][1]
- Hard-casting **Lotleth Giant** with big Battlement/Caretaker mana is a real line in grindy games, especially post-board when opponents bring in graveyard hate; the body plus enter-the-battlefield drain can close games without Dread Return.[1][2]
- Your wall package lets you play a slower midrange game when needed, attacking in the air with **Balustrade Spy** or chipping in with random creatures while holding the combo as a looming threat.[2][1]

## Mulligans and sequencing tips

- Keep hands that have: a way to find your first land (Land Grant or a landcycler), at least one ramp creature or landcycler, and at least one of your card selection spells (Winding Way, Lead, Farsight) or a Spy. Purely reactive hands without ramp or selection are usually too slow.[5][1][2]
- Sequence land search and landcycling early so you can safely cast **Land Grant** for free (reveal no lands) and so that by the time you have Spy and four mana, your library is basically landless.[4][1][2]
- Try to deploy extra creatures before comboing so that after you mill yourself you still have three bodies to sacrifice to Dread Return; this often means sandbagging Spy until you can play it and immediately flash back Dread Return in the same turn.[1][2]

## Sideboard roles (from list given)

- **Mesmeric Fiend**: Bring in versus combo and control to clear counterspells and critical interaction before you go off; you can also sacrifice it to Dread Return after stripping a card.[2][1]
- **Faerie Macabre**: Free graveyard hate against opposing combo and recursion decks that try to race or interact on the graveyard axis.[7][1]
- **Flaring Pain**: Essential versus Prismatic Strands, Moment’s Peace, or fog-style effects that would otherwise blank your lethal attack or Giant trigger.[5][1]
- **Nylea’s Disciple** and **Scattershot Archer**: Come in against aggressive decks and flyers; Disciple buys you life and time, Archer cleans up Faeries and small fliers that pressure your life total or carry disruption.[1][2]
