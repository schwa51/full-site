This is a Tron-based artifact combo deck that assembles **Urza’s Mine/Power Plant/Tower** for huge mana, then loops **Myr Retriever** with **Ashnod’s Altar** to generate infinite mana and artifacts, usually winning through **Golem Foundry** while card draw spells keep the engine running.

## Game plan overview

- Early turns focus on assembling Tron with **Expedition Map** and fixing colors with cheap artifacts like **Chromatic Star**, **Prophetic Prism**, **Candy Trail**, **Energy Refractor**, and **Nihil Spellbomb**.
- Once Tron is online, you use your massive mana to chain cantrips and card advantage spells such as **Eviscerator’s Insight** and **Malevolent Rumble**, digging for **Ashnod’s Altar**, **Myr Retriever**, and **Golem Foundry**.
- Throughout, you can incidentally pressure the opponent with **Conduit Pylons** pings and stabilize life with **Weather the Storm** while setting up a lethal combo turn.

## Primary combo lines

- Core loop: With **Ashnod’s Altar** in play and two **Myr Retrievers** (one on the battlefield and one in the graveyard), you sacrifice the Myr to the Altar, generate 2 colorless mana, and return the other Retriever; recasting and repeating gives you effectively infinite colorless mana and infinite “artifact entered the battlefield” triggers.
- Win condition: **Golem Foundry** pays you off for those artifact casts, making a 3/3 Golem every three triggers so you can create an arbitrarily large army and attack for lethal on the next turn (or immediately, if the board is already developed and the opponent is low).
- Value line: Even without the full loop, sacrificing random artifacts and Retrievers to the Altar fuels **Eviscerator’s Insight**, **Malevolent Rumble**, and other card-advantage plays, often digging you into Tron pieces, more combo parts, or **Weather the Storm**.

## Tron, cantrips, and setup

- **Urza’s Mine/Power Plant/Tower** plus basic Forest/Swamp give you the mana to cast multiple spells each turn; prioritize Maps and card selection that find missing Tron pieces over everything else until you have at least two different Urza lands.
- Cheap artifacts like **Chromatic Star**, **Candy Trail**, **Prophetic Prism**, and **Nihil Spellbomb** smooth colors, draw into business, increase artifact count for Foundry, and are great fodder for **Ashnod’s Altar** later.
- **Malevolent Rumble** and **Eviscerator’s Insight** are your engine cards: with Tron online they dig deep, pick up lands or spells as needed, and fill the graveyard with Retrievers and utility artifacts for future loops.

## Mulligans and sequencing tips

- Keep hands that either: already have two distinct Tron pieces plus a way to find the third (Map, cantrips), or have strong card selection (multiple Stars/Prisms/Trails) and at least one land; hands without early mana or card flow are usually too slow.
- Try to develop mana and card filtering first, then deploy **Golem Foundry** and **Ashnod’s Altar** so you can start turning small artifacts and Retrievers into real pressure without overcommitting into artifact hate too early.
- When assembling the Retriever loop, it is often safer to wait until you can execute most of the chain in a single turn, minimizing how long Ashnod’s Altar sits exposed on the battlefield.

## Sideboard roles

- **Weather the Storm**: Comes in against burn and fast aggro; your cheap artifacts and spell-heavy turns make gaining 9–20 life at once very realistic.
- **Ancient Grudge**: Efficient artifact hate for mirror matches, Affinity, or other artifact-centric decks; flashback is easy with your green splash.
- **Blue Elemental Blast / Red Elemental Blast**: Blasts handle problem blue or red spells—countering removal, counterspells, or haymakers that threaten your combo or Tron lands.
- **Breath Weapon**: Sweeper versus go-wide creature decks; your deck mostly plays artifacts and can often survive a symmetrical damage-based wrath better than the opponent.
- **Fangren Marauder**: A huge stabilizer against aggro and midrange, gaining 5 life for each artifact that hits your graveyard and turning your normal game actions into massive life swings.
- **Temporal Intervention**: Protection and tempo tool that can blank a critical removal spell or sweeper on your combo pieces or save a key permanent while still advancing your plan.
