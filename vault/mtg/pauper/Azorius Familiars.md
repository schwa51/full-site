This is an Azorius Familiars control-combo deck that uses **Sunscape Familiar** to reduce your blue and white spell costs, then abuses blink spells with **Mulldrifter**, **Archaeomancer**, and **Cryogen Relic** to bury the opponent in cards while soft-locking combat with **Stonehorn Dignitary** and protecting your life total with **God-Pharaoh’s Faithful**.[1][2][3]

## Game plan overview

- Develop early with taplands and cantrips: use **Preordain**, **The Modern Age**, and **Lórien Revealed** to hit land drops and find **Sunscape Familiar** while **God-Pharaoh’s Faithful** pads your life against early pressure.[2][3][1]
- Once you resolve a Familiar, your blue and white spells become much cheaper, letting you chain multiple cantrips and value creatures like **Mulldrifter** in a single turn.[4][1][2]
- From there, you aim to establish repeatable value and control: looping **Ghostly Flicker** with **Archaeomancer** and value permanents, and setting up a fog lock with **Stonehorn Dignitary** when needed.[5][6][1]

## Core engines and combo lines

- Value engine 1 – Flicker loops: With **Sunscape Familiar** plus **Ghostly Flicker** targeting **Archaeomancer** and **Cryogen Relic** (or **Mulldrifter**), you can repeatedly draw cards while returning Flicker to hand, effectively generating a repeatable **Divination** that gets cheaper with more Familiars.[7][1][5]
- Value engine 2 – Snap mana loop: **Snap** untaps two lands; with cost reduction from one or more Familiars and bounce-lands like **Azorius Chancery**, Snap can net mana while removing a creature, enabling big “storm” turns where you chain Snaps, Preordains, and draw spells.[6][1][2]
- Lock pieces – Combat and life: **Stonehorn Dignitary** plus **Ephemerate** or **Ghostly Flicker** can effectively lock an opponent out of combat, while multiple **God-Pharaoh’s Faithful** trigger off nearly every spell you cast to gain huge chunks of life and make racing impossible.[1][2][7]

## Interaction and control tools

- **Prohibit**, **Foil**, and **Negate** (from the board) give you stack interaction to protect your engines and stop opposing bombs; thanks to your card draw, you can afford to hold up countermagic in key turns.[8][4][1]
- **Prismatic Strands** and **Snap** are your main tempo and protection tools against creature decks, preventing lethal swings and buying time to get Familiars online.[9][2][1]
- **Murmuring Mystic** turns your constant stream of cheap spells into an army of fliers that can end the game while you sit behind life gain and fog effects.[7][1]

## Mulligans and sequencing tips

- Keep hands with: at least two lands, a cantrip (**Preordain** or **The Modern Age**) and either a **Sunscape Familiar**, a way to find one (card draw), or early stabilization (God-Pharaoh’s Faithful plus interaction). One-landers without Preordain are generally too risky.[3][2][1]
- Try to land a Familiar as soon as you can safely protect it; often you want to cast Familiar with a blue mana up for **Prohibit** or with **Prismatic Strands** available in the graveyard to blank a removal turn.[10][2][1]
- Sequence your flicker spells to maximize value: for example, Flicker **Mulldrifter** plus **Cryogen Relic**, then later transition into looping **Archaeomancer** plus a value target once you have enough mana and Familiars.[5][1][7]

## Sideboard roles (from list given)

- **Circle of Protection: Blue**: Excellent versus blue tempo and combo decks; it blanks large chunks of their damage while you set up your engines.[11][1]
- **Hydroblast** and **Negate**: Come in against red decks and spell-based strategies to efficiently answer burn, land destruction, and combo pieces.[2][4][1]
- **Dust to Dust**: High-impact artifact hate against Affinity, Tron, and artifact combo; exiling two artifacts for three mana is a huge tempo swing.[11][1][2]
- **Stonehorn Dignitary** (extra copies) and **Thraben Charm**: Dignitary further strengthens your fog lock versus creature decks, while Thraben Charm offers flexible graveyard hate or removal to shore up specific matchups.[1][2]
