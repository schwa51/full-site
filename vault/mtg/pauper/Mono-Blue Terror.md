This is a mono-blue tempo-control deck that uses cheap cantrips and self-mill to power out undercosted fatties (**Tolarian Terror**, **Cryptic Serpent**) while protecting them with counters and soft removal.

## Game plan overview

- Spend the early turns sculpting your hand and graveyard with **Ponder**, **Brainstorm**, **Lórien Revealed**, **Mental Note**, and **Thought Scour**, while holding up **Counterspell** or **Dispel** when possible.
- As your graveyard fills with instants and sorceries, drop cheap **Tolarian Terror** and **Cryptic Serpent**, often for 1–3 mana, then ride one or two big creatures to victory while you keep the opponent off-balance with counters and tap effects.
- **Murmuring Mystic** gives you an alternate plan in grindy games, turning your constant stream of spells into a growing army of 1/1 fliers.

## Spells, self-mill, and threats

- **Mental Note** and **Thought Scour** both cantrip while stocking your graveyard, turbo-charging cost reduction for Terror and Serpent and occasionally clearing bad **Brainstorm** tops.
- **Sleep of the Dead** is cheap interaction that also fuels your graveyard, letting you tap key blockers or attackers and later escape it for more value.
- Once you’ve cast enough spells, **Tolarian Terror** is your premier threat (ward is huge), with **Cryptic Serpent** as extra copies that still come down well ahead of curve.

## Interaction and play patterns

- **Counterspell** is your default answer to anything important; **Dispel** backs it up against opposing removal and countermagic so your big creatures stick.
- **Deem Inferior** gives you a cheap, scalable removal spell that works especially well when your graveyard is already full from Thought Scour/Mental Note.
- You usually want to play at instant speed: cantrip or self-mill on their end step if they don’t present a must-counter spell, then untap into a cheap Terror plus counter backup.

## Mulligans and sequencing tips

- Keep hands with at least two lands plus a mix of cantrips/self-mill and interaction (Counterspell/Deem/Dispel); you don’t need an early Terror if your spells are flowing.
- Use **Lórien Revealed** early as land-finding, then later as a hard draw spell once you’re flooded; this “Xerox” setup lets you play only 16 Islands but still hit land drops.
- Try not to cast **Brainstorm** without a shuffle effect (Lórien cycling) or a mill spell ready; pairing Brainstorm with **Thought Scour** is ideal to clear away dead cards.

## Sideboard roles (from list given)

- **Annul**: Cheap answer to artifacts and enchantments (Affinity, Bogles, Tron mana rocks, etc.).
- **Blue Elemental Blast / Hydroblast**: Against red decks and land-destruction, stopping burn or key hate cards.
- **Gut Shot**: Free answer to small creatures (Faeries, Delvers, token makers) without leaving up mana.
- **Piracy Charm** and **Envelop**: Flexible tools—Charm kills X/1s or loots in a pinch, Envelop hits sorcery-speed haymakers like sweepers and big draw spells.
