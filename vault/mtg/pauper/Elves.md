This is a classic green creature combo deck where you flood the board with Elves, make absurd amounts of mana with **Priest of Titania**, then either overrun the opponent with giant attackers (often via **Timberwatch Elf** or **Nyxborn Hydra**) or bury them under card advantage.[1][2][3]

## Game plan overview

- Start by curving out mana dorks: **Elvish Mystic**, **Fyndhorn Elves**, and **Llanowar Elves** into **Priest of Titania**, using **Quirion Ranger** to effectively double your Priest or land each turn.[2][4][1]
- Use that mana to keep deploying more creatures and cast engine spells like **Lead the Stampede** and **Winding Way**, which often draw you 3–4 creatures at a time and refill your hand.[4][5][1]
- As your battlefield grows, leverage **Timberwatch Elf**, **Nyxborn Hydra**, and **Avenging Hunter** to present huge attacks that are difficult to block or race.[6][7][1]

## Key engines and finishers

- **Priest of Titania** is your primary engine: once there are a few Elves in play, she taps for 4+ mana, especially powerful when untapped by **Quirion Ranger** to cast big spells or chains of creatures.[1][2][4]
- **Timberwatch Elf** lets any random Elf become a lethal threat; with many Elves out and Ranger to untap it, multiple activations per turn can one‑shot an opponent through blockers.[3][2][1]
- **Nyxborn Hydra** and **Avenging Hunter** convert big mana into resilient finishers—Hydra enters with a massive pile of counters, while Hunter gives you the initiative and a large trampler that quickly ends the game.[8][9][1]

## Utility creatures and interaction

- **Masked Vandal** gives you main‑deck artifact/enchantment hate, exiling key pieces while still counting as an Elf body.[10][4][1]
- **Wellwisher** stabilizes races by gaining huge amounts of life once you have a wide board; just a couple of activations can put you far out of reach of Burn and aggro.[5][2][1]
- **Vitu‑Ghazi Inspector** and **Generous Ent** provide card selection and land consistency (Ent via landcycling), smoothing your draws and ensuring you keep hitting land drops for spells like **Monstrous Emergence** and **Pulse of Murasa**.[11][8][1]

## Monstrous Emergence, adventure, and recursion

- **Monstrous Emergence** gives you a surprise giant threat out of your land, which works especially well in a deck that can rebuild quickly after removal or sweepers.[12][13][1]
- **Pulse of Murasa** buys back key creatures (Priest, Timberwatch, Nyxborn Hydra) while gaining 6 life, letting you out‑grind removal‑heavy decks and stabilize against aggressive starts.[3][4][1]
- **Spinewoods Paladin** adds another large, trampling body that takes advantage of your abundant mana and helps break through board stalls.[7][14][1]

## Mulligans and sequencing tips

- Keep hands with: at least one Forest, a one‑mana Elf, and either **Priest of Titania** or a draw spell (Lead/Winding Way); hands without early mana creatures are much slower and usually worse.[2][1][3]
- Use **Quirion Ranger** early to pick up a tapped Forest and replay it, effectively generating extra mana, and later to untap Priest, Timberwatch, or Wellwisher for explosive turns.[4][1][2]
- Try to cast **Lead the Stampede** and **Winding Way** when your hand is nearly empty so they refuel you fully; after a big draw, immediately dump more creatures to grow your board and set up lethal Timberwatch or Hydra attacks the following turn.[5][1][3]
