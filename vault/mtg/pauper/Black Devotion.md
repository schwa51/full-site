This is a mono‑black control deck that wins by building up **devotion to black** with creatures and removal, then slamming **Gray Merchant of Asphodel** for huge life‑drain swings while locking the board down.[1][2][3]

## Game plan overview

- Spend the early turns killing creatures with **Defile**, **Cast Down**, and **Chainer’s Edict**, and disrupting hands with **Duress** while developing cheap bodies like **Cuombajj Witches** and **Phyrexian Rager**.[2][4][1]
- Use **Chittering Rats** to mess up draws and add two black pips, and **Sign in Blood** to keep cards flowing so you never run out of interaction.[3][1][2]
- Once you have a solid board with multiple black permanents, drop **Gray Merchant of Asphodel** (“Gary”) to drain for 5+ life at a time, often closing the game in two shots.[5][1][2]

## Removal, sweepers, and control

- **Defile**, **Cast Down**, and **Chainer’s Edict** are your bread‑and‑butter removal suite, handling almost any single creature efficiently.[4][1][2]
- **Crypt Rats**, **Suffocating Fumes**, and a one‑of **Pestilence** give you scalable sweepers to wipe go‑wide decks, often gaining life back later via Gary or **Tendrils of Corruption**.[6][1][2]
- **Cuombajj Witches** cleans up X/1s while contributing devotion, but you must stack the pings carefully so you don’t kill your own small creatures unnecessarily.[1][2][3]

## Card advantage, monarch, and recursion

- **Sign in Blood** and **Phyrexian Rager** are your main draw engines, trading a bit of life for extra cards; your lifegain from Gary and Tendrils easily pays that back.[2][5][1]
- **Thorn of the Black Rose** makes you the monarch, adding steady card advantage and another double‑black body that blocks well and discourages attacks.[7][1][2]
- **Unearth** and **Witch’s Cottage** recur key creatures (Rager, Rats, Gary, Thorn), letting you reuse ETB effects and rebuild devotion after removal.[8][1][2]

## Graveyard tools and life swings

- **Bojuka Bog** and sideboard **Nihil Spellbomb** provide efficient graveyard hate versus Terror, Tron, and recursion decks, while still fitting your mana base and card‑flow plan.[4][1][2]
- **Crypt Incursion** can swing creature matchups by exiling their graveyard and gaining you an enormous chunk of life, buying multiple extra turns to find Gary.[1][2][4]
- **Syphon Life** gives you inevitability in stalled games, repeatedly draining for small chunks while also benefiting from all the extra land draws and long game.[2][1]

## Mulligans and sequencing tips

- Keep hands with: at least two Swamps, one or two pieces of cheap removal (Defile/Cast Down/Edict), and either a card‑draw spell (Sign in Blood/Rager) or an early threat (Cuombajj Witches/Chittering Rats). One‑landers or hands with only expensive spells are usually mulligans.[4][1][2]
- Try to sequence **Chittering Rats** when the opponent is low on cards or after a shuffle effect, maximizing the “time walk” effect and buying extra time for Gary.[3][1][2]
- Don’t rush **Gray Merchant of Asphodel**; wait until you have several black permanents so the first ETB represents a big life swing, and use **Unearth** or Cottage to set up a second Gary if needed.[5][1][2]

## Sideboard roles (from list given)

- **Divest / Duress**: Extra hand disruption versus combo, control, and Tron; strip key threats or sweepers before committing Gary or Thorn.[9][1][2]
- **Nihil Spellbomb**, **Reaping the Graves**: Spellbomb vs graveyard decks; Reaping the Graves shines in grindy, spell‑heavy games by buying back multiple creatures at instant speed.[1][2]
- **Okiba‑Gang Shinobi**: Powerful against control and midrange; ninjutsu it in on an unblocked creature to rip two cards and then pressure life totals while adding devotion.[2][4][1]
