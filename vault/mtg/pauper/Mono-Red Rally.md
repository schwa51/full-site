This is a low-to-the-ground mono-red aggro deck that floods the board with cheap creatures, then uses **Rally at the Hornburg**, **Goblin Bushwhacker**, and burn spells to deliver huge early damage spikes that end the game quickly.

## Game plan overview

- Curve out with one-drops like **Goblin Tomb Raider** and **Voldaren Epicure**, then double-spell on turn two with **Burning-Tree Emissary** into more threats or setup spells like **Experimental Synthesizer**.
- Aim for explosive turns where you cast **Rally at the Hornburg** (often off Burning-Tree mana) and then follow with **Goblin Bushwhacker** to give your whole team haste and a power boost.
- Use **Lightning Bolt**, **Chain Lightning**, and **Galvanic Blast** primarily to clear blockers early, then redirect them upstairs once your big Rally/Bushwhacker attack has brought the opponent low.

## Key synergies and kill turns

- The classic nut draw is: turn one Tomb Raider or Epicure, turn two **Burning-Tree Emissary** into **Rally at the Hornburg**, then turn three **Goblin Bushwhacker** kicked; this can easily present double-digit damage by turn three.
- **Clockwork Percussionist** hits hard for three mana and dodges a lot of common damage-based removal; it also scales very well with Bushwhacker and Rally, turning your pump turns into even bigger swings.
- **Reckless Impulse** and **Experimental Synthesizer** keep your hand full after you dump early threats, letting you chain more burn or another Rally turn to finish the job.

## Interaction and reach

- **Galvanic Blast** is almost always 4 damage thanks to artifact lands and Synthesizer, giving you both efficient removal and reach to close games.
- **End the Festivities** (maindeck and sideboard copies) and **Cast into the Fire** help clear small blockers and token boards that would otherwise brick your go-wide attacks.
- Between 4 Bolts, 2 Chains, 4 Blasts, and **Searing Blaze** in the board, you often finish opponents from 6–10 life over one or two turns without needing to keep attacking.

## Mulligans and sequencing tips

- Keep hands that have at least one land, an early creature (Tomb Raider/Epicure), and either **Burning-Tree Emissary** or card advantage (Impulse/Synthesizer); hands of pure burn without creatures are weaker in this build.
- Try to line up **Rally at the Hornburg** on turn two if possible, especially off Emissary mana, then save **Goblin Bushwhacker** for the follow-up turn to maximize damage.
- Be mindful of sweepers: against decks with **Fiery Cannonade** or **Krark-Clan Shaman**, stagger your threats and hold back a Rally/Bushwhacker combo turn for when you can lethal in one swing.

## Sideboard roles (from list given)

- **Red Elemental Blast**: Bring in versus blue control and combo to force through Rally, Bushwhacker, and your card-draw spells.
- **Relic of Progenitus**: Graveyard hate against Reanimator, TortEx, Tron, and other recursion decks, while cantripping when no longer needed.
- **Searing Blaze**: Excellent against creature decks; kills a blocker while pushing damage to the face, perfect for keeping the path clear for your big Rally turns.
