This is a go-wide mono-white aggro deck that plays efficient creatures and token-makers, then snowballs value with **Kor Skyfisher** and wins in the air with **Battle Screech** backed by team pumps and protection spells.[1][2][3]

## Game plan overview

- Curve out with cheap creatures: **Thraben Inspector**, **Novice Inspector**, **Lunarch Veteran**, and **Raffine’s Informant** all give you early bodies plus cards, life, or card selection.[3][4][1]
- Use **Kor Skyfisher** to rebuy enters-the-battlefield effects (both Inspectors, Veteran, Idyllic Grange) and to reset utility lands, steadily building card advantage while adding to the board.[2][1][3]
- Transition into an air assault with **Battle Screech** tokens, **Spider‑Man, Web‑Slinger**, and **Summon: Choco/Mog**, then finish games with pump effects like **Guardians’ Pledge** and equipment like **Greatsword of Tyr**.[5][1][2]

## Token engines and finishers

- **Battle Screech** is your main payoff: cast it for four mana, then flash it back by tapping three creatures to make four fliers total, which quickly dominate the skies when backed by pumps.[6][1][3]
- **Thraben Inspector** and **Novice Inspector** keep your hand full via Clues while also giving you cheap bodies to crew Screech’s flashback and wear pumps or equipment.[4][1][5]
- **Spider‑Man, Web‑Slinger** and **Summon: Choco/Mog** are high-impact three-drops: Spider-Man is an aggressively-costed 3/3 that works well with bouncing and tapping creatures, while Choco/Mog doubles as a pump spell and a creature to keep pressure high.[7][8][1]

## Interaction and protection

- **Journey to Nowhere** and **Thraben Charm** handle problematic creatures or graveyards while still fitting your low-curve plan.[1][3][7]
- **Prismatic Strands** is your key defensive piece, letting you fog an entire color (often twice thanks to flashback) and blow out opposing combat steps or burn turns.[3][1]
- In sideboard games, **Dust to Dust**, **Revoke Existence**, and **Standard Bearer** give you powerful tools against Affinity, auras, and targeted removal or pump spells.[9][10][1]

## Mulligans and sequencing tips

- Keep hands with: at least two lands, an early one-drop (Inspector/Veteran), and either **Kor Skyfisher**, **Battle Screech**, or another value creature (Raffine’s Informant). Purely reactive hands or ones without early plays are much weaker.[11][1][3]
- Try to sequence Inspectors and Idyllic Grange before **Kor Skyfisher** so you can bounce and replay them for repeated value; similarly, plan Screech for turns where you can cast and flash it back in the same turn to minimize exposure to sweepers.[6][1][3]
- Use life-gain creatures (**Lunarch Veteran**, **Lone Missionary**) to stabilize races and to make aggressive blocks you otherwise couldn’t take; your air force and pumps are usually good enough to close games once you reach parity.[12][1][3]

## Sideboard roles (from list given)

- **Dust to Dust / Revoke Existence**: Bring in versus Affinity and artifact decks; Dust to Dust in particular is a huge tempo and card-advantage swing.[9][1][3]
- **Holy Light**: Sweeper against small creature decks (Faeries, Elves, tokens) that often spares your own larger creatures.[1][3]
- **Hallow**: Excellent versus Burn and other big single-shot damage spells, often turning their best burn into a massive life swing for you.[10][1]
- **Standard Bearer**: Forces targeted pumps and removal to hit it, protecting your key threats and messing up combat math for decks relying on auras or combat tricks.[10][9][1]
