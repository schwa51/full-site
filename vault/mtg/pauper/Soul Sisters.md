This is an Orzhov life‑gain deck that floods the board with “Soul Sisters,” then turns all those life triggers into a huge **Celestial Unicorn** and repeat drain from **Marauding Blight‑Priest**, often winning without ever really racing in combat.[1][2][3]

## Game plan overview

- Develop early with **Soul Warden**, **Soul’s Attendant**, and **Suture Priest**, then follow up with value creatures like **Spirited Companion**, **Squadron Hawk**, and **Priest of Ancient Lore** to generate multiple life‑gain triggers and cards.[3][4][1]
- As your life total climbs, drop **Celestial Unicorn** and **Marauding Blight‑Priest** so every future life‑gain grows your beater or drains the opponent, making blocking and racing very difficult for them.[5][6][1]
- Use **Battle Screech** to create a big flying board that triggers your sisters four times at once and then closes out the game in the air.[4][1][3]

## Engines and payoffs

- The core engine is multiple Soul Sister effects plus cheap creatures: each **Squadron Hawk** or Screech creates a burst of life‑gain that stacks quickly when you have two or three sisters out.[7][1][4]
- **Celestial Unicorn** becomes enormous over just a couple of turns of normal development; protecting or rebuying it with **Unearth** lets you keep a massive threat on board for very little mana.[6][8][1]
- **Marauding Blight‑Priest** gives you reach, turning all that life‑gain into direct life‑loss so you can win even if the battlefield clogs up.[2][1][5]

## Card advantage and interaction

- **Spirited Companion**, **Squadron Hawk**, and **Priest of Ancient Lore** all draw cards while also triggering your sisters, so you rarely run out of gas in long games.[9][10][1]
- **Night’s Whisper** tops you back up on cards despite the life payment, which is trivial in a deck that routinely sits 10–20 life above starting total.[10][1]
- **Revoke Existence** (main and board) plus **Nihil Spellbomb** and **Leave No Trace** give you strong tools against artifacts, auras, and graveyard decks while keeping your curve low.[1][2][5]

## Mulligans and sequencing tips

- Keep hands with: at least two lands, one Soul Sister (Warden/Attendant/Priest), and either a value creature (Companion/Hawk/Priest of Ancient Lore) or a payoff (Unicorn/Blight‑Priest). Hands without an early sister are much weaker.[11][3][1]
- Lead with a Soul Sister whenever possible so every later creature immediately gains you life; try to follow with **Squadron Hawk** to restock your hand and spike multiple triggers.[4][7][1]
- **Unearth** should usually target Unicorn or Blight‑Priest rather than small bodies; hold it to rebuild after removal rather than cycling too early.[8][1]

## Sideboard roles (from list given)

- **Nihil Spellbomb**: Graveyard hate versus Terror, Tron, and reanimator, with a card draw tacked on.[5][1]
- **Leave No Trace** and extra **Revoke Existence**: Anti‑Bogles and artifact/enchantment decks; Leave No Trace can be a blowout against multiple auras.[12][1][5]
- **Prismatic Strands**: Excellent versus Burn and creature decks, letting you fog combat or burn turns—often twice thanks to flashback and your many white creatures.[7][1][5]
