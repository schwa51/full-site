This is a Grixis Affinity midrange deck that floods the board with cheap artifacts, then turns them into cards and damage with **Thoughtcast**, **Reckoner’s Bargain**, **Fanatical Offering**, **Black Mage’s Rod**, and **Makeshift Munitions**, while **Krark-Clan Shaman** and efficient removal keep the battlefield clear.[1][2][3]

## Game plan overview

- Use artifact lands and bridges (**Great Furnace**, **Drossforge Bridge**, **Mistvault Bridge**, **Silverbluff Bridge**, **Seat of the Synod**, **Vault of Whispers**) plus cheap artifacts like **Ichor Wellspring**, **Nihil Spellbomb**, and **Cryogen Relic** to turn on affinity quickly.[2][4][1]
- Cast discounted threats (**Myr Enforcer**, **Refurbished Familiar**) and refill with **Thoughtcast**, **Reckoner’s Bargain**, **Fanatical Offering**, and **Toxin Analysis**, which all turn expendable artifacts into raw cards and sometimes life gain.[3][1][2]
- As the game goes long, leverage **Black Mage’s Rod** and **Makeshift Munitions** to convert your excess artifacts into direct damage so you can close out games even through stalled boards.[5][6][1]

## Combat, removal, and Rod kills

- **Galvanic Blast** is your premium removal and reach spell, almost always turned on for 4 damage thanks to your high artifact count.[1][2]
- **Krark-Clan Shaman** gives you a repeatable, controllable sweeper: you can sacrifice multiple artifacts before the ability resolves to deal multiple waves of 1 damage and wipe go-wide creature decks.[7][3][1]
- **Black Mage’s Rod** turns your sacrifice and card-draw actions into burn; combining it with loops of **Refurbished Familiar**, Wellsprings, and sacrifice spells lets you stack up a surprising amount of damage without attacking.[6][5][1]

## Card advantage engines

- **Ichor Wellspring**, **Cryogen Relic**, and **Nihil Spellbomb** all replace themselves or generate value when they enter or leave the battlefield, making them ideal fodder for **Reckoner’s Bargain**, **Fanatical Offering**, **Krark-Clan Shaman**, and **Makeshift Munitions**.[2][3][1]
- **Refurbished Familiar** provides recurring value: it draws a card when it ETBs and can be brought back with **Blood Fountain**, giving you a steady stream of bodies and triggers for Rod or sacrifice outlets.[5][1][2]
- **Thoughtcast** is your classic affinity draw spell, often costing only one blue mana and refilling your hand so you can keep up the pressure and interaction.[1][2]

## Mulligans and sequencing tips

- Keep hands with at least two mana sources (artifact lands/bridges) plus either: a payoff creature (**Myr Enforcer** or Familiar), a card draw engine (**Thoughtcast**, sac outlet plus Wellspring), or early interaction (**Galvanic Blast**, **Krark-Clan Shaman**). Extremely slow, spell-heavy hands without early artifacts are risky.[8][2][1]
- Sequence artifact lands and cheap artifacts first to maximize affinity discounts; it is often better to delay **Thoughtcast** by a turn if it means drawing two for a single blue mana instead of paying more.[2][1]
- Against creature decks, prioritize landing **Krark-Clan Shaman** early and keep extra artifacts in play so you can threaten a board wipe at instant speed; against control, focus on card draw and Rod/Munitions damage to grind through removal.[9][7][1]

## Sideboard roles (from list given)

- **Hydroblast / Blue Elemental Blast**: Excellent versus red decks (Burn, Jeskai, red midrange), cheaply answering burn, removal, and problem permanents.[10][1][2]
- **Pyroblast / Red Elemental Blast**: Come in versus blue control and combo to fight counterspells, card draw, and key payoffs.[10][1][2]
- **Gorilla Shaman**: Devastating against other artifact decks and some mana-bases; with plenty of colorless mana you can quickly eat opposing artifact lands.[9][10][1]
- Extra **Krark-Clan Shaman**, **Breath Weapon**, and **Unexpected Fangs**: Shaman and Breath Weapon further shore up go-wide creature matchups, while Fangs gives lifelink and a counter to a key threat, helping stabilize versus aggressive decks.[7][9][1]
