## Description
Man of the South (Thief Leader)
Broad-shouldered and imposing, Baran has a burn scar running down the left side of his face. His eyes are dark and sunken, and he limps slightly from an old war wound. He wears his sword like a badge of identity, even in places it draws unease. Survival has made him cruel, but there is a flicker of the man he once was. Friends with [[kadran_of_harondor|Kadran]]. See [[song-barans-lament|Baran's Lament]].
