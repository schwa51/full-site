## Description
Eledan is a wiry, weathered man with clever eyes and a sun-lined face. He wears a patched green wool cloak and carries a carved ashwood staff marked with tiny symbols and notches. His satchel rattles with odd relics and packets of herbs, scrolls, and pipeweed. His boots are always muddy, and he smells faintly of pine and old paper.
## Role in the Story
#### Connection to Goewen
A familiar face from [[Goewen]]'s years at Forest’s Edge in Forlindon, Eledan visited regularly as a trader and friend of the village. He respected the elves’ eccentricity and was especially fond of Goewen’s curiosity and kindness. He taught her practical herbal names and old human songs, and brought tales of Radagast’s travels from the road.
