###### Name: Eledan Thornfoot
###### Race: Man
###### Occupation: Traveling Trader, Lore-broker, Pathfinder
###### Age: Early 60's
###### Region: Typically Lindon and the Western Roads

## Description
Eledan is a wiry, weathered man with clever eyes and a sun-lined face. He wears a patched green wool cloak and carries a carved ashwood staff marked with tiny symbols and notches. His satchel rattles with odd relics and packets of herbs, scrolls, and pipeweed. His boots are always muddy, and he smells faintly of pine and old paper.
## Role in the Story
#### Connection to Goewen
A familiar face from Goewen’s[[pf-Geowen]] years at Forest’s Edge in Forlindon, Eledan visited regularly as a trader and friend of the village. He respected the elves’ eccentricity and was especially fond of Goewen’s curiosity and kindness. He taught her practical herbal names and old human songs, and brought tales of Radagast’s travels from the road.
#### Connection to the Rune-Key
Eledan is the trader who sold the rune-key to Balin in Bree. He found it hidden under a stone near the South Downs, sealed in a lead-lined box. Though unaware of its full import, he guessed it was Dwarf-make and saved it until he met Balin.
## Traits
- Lore-Touched Wanderer: +2 to Lore checks involving ruins, trade routes, or elven and dwarven relics.  
- Living Map: May offer safe paths or shortcuts once per session.  
- Tales for the Hearth: Restores 1 Shadow point when resting with the Company through shared story.
## Voice & Demeanor

- Warm, curious, and just a little wistful.

- Speaks slowly and deliberately, as if savoring his words or trying to remember something long lost.

- Sounds like someone who's **walked too far**, seen too much, and **still believes stories are worth the telling**.
## Hooks
- May know of another relic near the sea cliffs of Forlindon.
## Usage
Eledan may appear in Bree[[pf-The Village of Bree.md]], at a Ranger camp, or along a remote trade route. He is useful as a lore source, character anchor, and potential bearer of new leads or mysterious knowledge.
## Quotes
- “Thornfoot, yes. Like the weed, or the wound—depends who you ask.”
- “The stones remember, if you step quiet.”
- “Funny thing about old keys: they never unlock the door you think they do.”

## Physical Mannerisms

- **Touches the side of his nose** when recalling a detail, as if nudging memory into place.

- **Flicks the edge of his cloak or satchel** absently when thinking, as if searching for a lost object.

- **Hums low tunes** with no words—half-forgotten travel songs or Elvish lullabies.

- **Writes with a thumb in the air** when thinking, as though sketching unseen words or maps.

- When serious: **lowers his voice and leans in**, as if trading secrets with the wind.
