###### Name: Hilda the Vast  
###### Race: Man  
###### Occupation: Farmhand, Part-Time Bouncer  
###### Age: Late 20s  
###### Region: Bree-land  

## Description
Hilda is a mountain of a woman—tall, broad, and strong as an ox team. Her rough features and unladylike stature have made her the butt of many cruel jests, and she's known in whispers as the “ugliest young lady in Bree-land, and possibly beyond.” Yet to those who know her, she’s steady, thoughtful, and unexpectedly graceful. She favors plain tunics, thick boots, and usually has dirt on her hands from honest labor.

## Role in the Story
Hilda is no fool. She hears the gossip but lets it pass over her like rain on stone. She works hard, rarely complains, and helps out at the Prancing Pony when extra muscle is needed. What few know is that she’s quietly sweet on [[baran_the_scarred]]|Baran]Baran—drawn to his calm, his steadiness, and the way he looks at her like she’s a person and not a punchline. Whether Baran returns her feelings is uncertain… but maybe not unhopeful.

## Traits
- Stronger than most men, quieter than most rumors  
- Keeps her dignity through stubborn grace  
- Watchful and loyal once trust is earned  
- Surprisingly well-read, especially in old tales of heroism and kindness

## Hooks
- Hilda has spotted figures near the South Gate at odd hours—and she’s been pretending not to see  
- She keeps a small book of pressed flowers and short poems, one of which might be about Baran  
- A local prankster once tried to humiliate her publicly. She broke his cartwheel with one hand and never said a word

## Usage
Hilda is ideal for offering emotional grounding, overlooked wisdom, or unexpected muscle. She may help the Company navigate Bree’s working class or carry critical information—particularly about patterns and people others don’t think to watch. She’ll risk much to protect Baran if danger threatens.

## Quotes
- “I’d rather be called Vast than Hollow.”  
- “They never look me in the eye. Baran does. That’s worth more than you’d think.”  
- “I know when I’m being lied to. And I know when someone’s worth listening to.”
