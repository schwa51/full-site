## Lyrics

## Ode to a Pie (and Other Friends)

<p class="dropcap">Give me a pie and a pint of good cheer,<p/>

And I’ll walk to the end of the Shire, my dear.

But keep your dragons and treasure and gloom—

I’d rather have mushrooms and plenty of room!

I once met an Elf with a silver harp,

He offered me starlight (but it wasn’t too sharp).

I traded instead for a loaf and some cheese,

And a warm spot of sun with a soft summer breeze.

For breakfast is noble, and second’s divine,

Elevenses follows with apples and brine.

Luncheon’s a feast, and tea is a dream—

And supper, dear friends, is the crown and the gleam!
