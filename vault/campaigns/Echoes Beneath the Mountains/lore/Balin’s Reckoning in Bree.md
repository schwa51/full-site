### My friends,

You have done what few of Durin’s Folk ever dreamed possible. You walked the silent streets of Ost-in-Edhil and returned with more than dust and broken stone. 

I have listened to your tale with keen heart—of how you slipped through a hole in the city wall, how some of you tarried in the old square while others scouted further, and how your company came together again in blood and smoke when Studs stumbled into the Spawn of Vakhul-Dur. It is no small thing to say you faced down such horrors and lived to tell it. 

You found the **Scroll of Healing** among the ruined dwellings, a gift from the Eldar long forgotten. You breathed foul airs in the **Mírdain Steps**, and when death itself clung to the rafters you answered with fire and ruin, shattering the **Black-Gut Takers** who lurked within. You stirred the notice of **Anárion’s company**, wary treasure-seekers like yourselves, and by fortune or fate you struck a truce. Their sketch of the city will serve us well. 

More precious still: you recovered the scroll with the **Dwarven Alloy Template**—clear proof of what I long suspected. Narvi himself wrought works in secret, preparing a forge near his own chambers in Khazad-dûm, in West Moria, and whisper spoke of a hidden **Citadel of the Ring-smiths**, veiled behind secret doors close to the Imperishable Hall. These are no idle rumors now. Your discoveries give us cause, and a course to follow. 

You have kindled the fire. Now it must burn in the deeps of Moria.

## What Comes Next

My mind is made. I will muster an expedition, to reclaim and to set again a King in Moria. Yet first, I ask of you a greater task than any before: go ahead of us and **scout the halls of Khazad-dûm.** 

Your charge is threefold: 

1. **Seek the lost forges of Narvi** and the **Citadel of the Ring-smiths**. If the Alloy Template speaks true, secrets of the Rings of Power yet lie waiting. 

2. **Scout the Enemy.** Learn where the Orcs have befouled our great Kingdom, and how many, and whether, as I suspect, battle in the North has thinned their number. 

3. **Find a Road.** Mark for us a safe passage from the **West-gate to the Dimrill Dale**, so when my folk march we may pass swiftly and unseen. 

Meet us in the **Dimrill Dale**, on the shores of **Mirrormere**, once you have scouted the way, and there we will meet again in two month’s time, to begin the work of reclaiming Khazad-dûm.

## A Season of Readiness

Between your return from Eregion and our departure, you have had weeks to gather strength. Time enough to hone skills, heal wounds, and choose how best to prepare. Think on what you have learned—of craft, of battle, of lore, of the Shadow itself. Let these days in Bree count as though you had journeyed and rested through many adventures. 

Take this time to grow: 

- **Practice and study:** strengthen your skills and attributes (spend the twelve Experience Points you have each earned). 

- **Undertake a work of your own choosing:** be it training, forging ties, or seeking wisdom. 

- **Heal and recover:** every wound and weariness is lifted before you step upon the West-road again.
