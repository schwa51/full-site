A personal vision granted to the Ranger upon touching the ancient stones of [[Barad Celen]].
  

As your hand brushes the weathered crest carved into the stone—a worn symbol of a star—you feel the air around you fall utterly still. Your breath catches. Then, like mist lifting from a mirror, the ruin vanishes.  
  
You stand within a great hall of stone, tall and proud. Light filters through high windows, falling on banners of silver and blue—the colors of Arnor. A company of noble warriors lines the walls, silent and solemn, hands resting upon sheathed blades.  
  
At their head is a man—tall, noble, and clad in gleaming mail. His face is younger than the one you will soon meet, but unmistakable. This is Herion, alive in his prime.  
  
He turns toward you, and though he does not speak, your heart answers a call deeper than words. You feel it in your bones—in your blood. This place, this man, this duty... they are part of you.  
  
Above, on a balcony, stands a child watching with wide eyes—a pendant around their neck, glinting in the golden light. You recognize it. You wear it now.  
  
A whisper like wind across the snow stirs the hall:  
  
‘Though the line falters, it does not fade. In you, our vow remembers itself.’  
  
The hall dims. The cold returns. The ruin surrounds you once more—but you are not alone.
