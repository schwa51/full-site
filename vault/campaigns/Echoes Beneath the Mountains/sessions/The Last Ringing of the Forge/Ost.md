**The Ruins of Ost-in-Edhil – Session Packet**

_An Exploration Scenario for The One Ring Second Edition_

---

### Session Overview

**Setting:** Ruins of Ost-in-Edhil, Eregion  
**Tone:** Wistful, decaying majesty; quiet danger; echoes of loss and ambition  
**Purpose:** Player-heroes explore ruins in search of ancient truths tied to the forging of the Rings of Power and secrets that may aid them in their coming journey into Moria.

### Structure

Use the node map and narrative prompts as a loose framework. Allow free exploration or guide by events (e.g., triggering visions, enemy approach, Anárion's NPCs urging a detour).

### Key Narrative Breadcrumbs

#### 1. Ring Lore Discoveries

**Broken Forge-Hall (Node N3 - Vaultward Steps)**  
_Clue:_ In a soot-stained alcove, heat or pressure reveals runes: _"Forged for wisdom, betrayed by fire."_  
_Effect:_ Elven/Dwarven PCs recognize this as the forging creed of the Gwaith-i-Mírdain. Implies unfinished or hidden works.

**Echoing Halls (Node N5 - Gemstreet & Vault Ends)**  
_Clue:_ A children’s scroll sealed in roots: _"A ring of stars with no end and no master."_  
_Effect:_ Lore test links this to the concept of a "Ring of Accord," resonating with the Jewel of Narvi.

**Court of Starfall (Node N6/N10)**  
_Clue:_ Faded mural of Elves and Dwarves forging together. One figure holds a silver-veined sapphire.  
_Effect:_ The Jewel of Narvi is foreshadowed. Dwarf PC may feel a strange pull or inspiration.

#### 2. Moria-Linked Secrets

**The Forgotten Steps (Node N9 - Cradle of Memory)**  
_Clue:_ Stone fragment reads: _"Durin’s bridge holds but one twin—seek its mirror in the west."_  
_Effect:_ Reference to a second, little-known westward route through Moria.

**Fountain of Still Light (Node N2 - Ashen Garth)**  
_Clue:_ Reflections show not PCs, but ancient dwarves traveling east under a glowing gem.  
_Effect:_ May trigger Shadow point if viewed too long, or Inspiration on successful Insight test.

**Shrine of Varda (Node N10 - Ghosted Lane)**  
_Clue:_ Dwarvish runes shaped like stars reference a place called "The Mouth of Moria."  
_Effect:_ Knowledge valuable to Balin or later maps.

### NPC Opportunities (Anárion’s Company)

- **Anárion:** May try to withhold access to some vaults or steer players away from key clues.
    
- **Maeril:** Reacts emotionally in the Court of Starfall or Echoing Halls—may share memories or poetry.
    
- **Roric:** Is silent but reverent in forge locations; could share a dream or fragment of ancestral memory.
    
- **Garan:** Cynical and guarded, but reacts strongly to Shrine of Varda; fears what's awakening in Moria.
    

---

### Optional Encounters

- **Misty Intruder:** A shadowy figure glimpsed in the distance; never confronts unless pursued.
    
- **Echo Trap:** A scroll case in N5 explodes in bright sound and light if opened without a riddle solved.
    
- **Silent Guardian:** In N6, signs that a guardian once stood here—missing now. Was it moved… or awakened?

### GM Notes

- Use environmental storytelling and mood to anchor players in the melancholy of lost greatness.
    
- Offer choices: pursue deeper mysteries or report findings to Balin.
    
- Reward Lore, Insight, and Song—this is a place of memory and meaning, not only danger.
