The gate of Bree creaks closed behind you, and the sounds of morning bustle fade like a song carried on the wind. Ahead stretches the old road—damp from spring rains, its stones mottled with moss, its edges swallowed by tufted grasses and tangled roots.

###### Sight:
The sun rises pale behind a veil of drifting cloud, casting long, shifting shadows across the downs. Hedges lean with age, and crooked trees cling to hilltops like sentinels. The horizon ripples with low green hills, their crests veiled in mist that catches gold at the edges.

###### Sound:
The world is hushed, save for the rhythmic crunch of your boots on the road and the occasional chirp of unseen larks. Somewhere in the distance, a raven caws—a deep, slow cry that echoes longer than it should.

###### Smell:
The air is clean but rich—laced with the damp, earthy scent of turned soil and the faint sweetness of heather and early wildflowers. Now and then, a whiff of old woodsmoke drifts on the breeze from some hidden farmstead.

###### Touch:
The morning wind has a soft bite to it—cool but not cruel. Your cloaks stir behind you, and fingertips brush the moisture that clings to leather straps and cloak hems. The road is uneven, and the earth beneath your soles is soft, occasionally giving way with a quiet squelch.

###### Taste:
The breath of the land is in your mouth—cool and metallic like stone after rain. There is a hint of green to it, like the taste of new grass or dew on your tongue.
