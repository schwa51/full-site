> *“We were here, once. And maybe the land was better for it.”*

  <strong>A Memory Unearthed</strong>
</div>

Long ago—before the Shire, before even Bree—there were Hobbits who wandered westward and paused among the gentle green shoulders of the South Downs.  
These were Harfoots: quiet, curious folk who dug the first burrows in Eriador.  
They settled the land with simple grace—stone rings for cooking fires, root-cellars, terraced hillsides, and lantern-lit glades where stories danced beneath the stars.

They lived in peace for generations, mostly unnoticed. But as the kingdoms of Men rose and the shadows of war lengthened, the little folk drifted northward.  
Some went to Bree. Some wandered further. Others vanished, leaving no names—only the land remembers.

If you listen carefully...

- A ring of mossy stones may reveal the soot of a long-cold fire.  
- A terraced bank might smile with the memory of gardens once full of pipeleaf.  
- A sunken hollow beneath hawthorn could have been a burrow’s door.  
- A silver thimble, a carved hairpin, a bone button—found in roots or after heavy rain—may be tokens of their hands.  
- And some trees, older than seems right, bloom out of season and whisper when no wind blows.

A Hobbit, or an Elf attuned to memory, might feel it:  
the warmth of laughter in the grass, the scent of a pipe rising from the ferns, the echo of small feet and big hearts.
