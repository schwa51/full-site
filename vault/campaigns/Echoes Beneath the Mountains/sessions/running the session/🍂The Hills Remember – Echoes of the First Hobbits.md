Long before the Shire was granted to the Hobbits by the Kings of Arthedain, long before even the word “Hobbit” was known to most Men, the **Harfoots** came wandering west. Some among them, weary of constant travel and drawn to gentle land, **settled among the green shoulders of the South Downs**.

These were the **first Hobbit-villages in Eriador**, older even than Bree. They were simple things—dug burrows in soft hillsoil, low stone walls, dry root-cellars, and open glades where food was shared and stories were traded beneath lantern-light.

They lived in peace, mostly unnoticed, for **two or three centuries**. But as the kingdoms of Men grew and war crept in from Angmar and the East, these little folk slowly drifted northward. Some went to Bree. Others entered the sheltered land to the West, eventually to be called the Shire.

**🌿** **What Still Remains**

Though no Hobbit lives in the South Downs now, **the hills remember** in quiet ways. A keen observer, a thoughtful Hobbit, or an Elf attuned to memory may notice the signs:

**🪨** **Stone Rings**

Near the root of a hill, a low circle of mossy stones may once have marked a gathering space or cooking hearth. If you clear the leaves, you might find tiny soot traces or carved stone pegs used to hang kettles.

**🌾** **Terraced Banks**

Some south-facing slopes show the remains of hand-cut terraces—overgrown and sunken, but still curved like gentle smiles. These were once **planted gardens**, filled with herbs and pipeleaf.

**🕳️** **Sunken Entrances**

A small dip in the earth, sheltered by old hawthorn, may once have been the entrance to a burrow. The wood is long rotted, but the **arch of earth remains**, resisting collapse. Some still have smooth interior stones.

**🪡** **Traces of Craft**

A silver thimble. A button of bone. A carved hairpin made from applewood. These things turn up in the roots of old trees, or in badger dens, or when a heavy rain lays the earth bare.

**🌳** **Whispering Trees**

A few gnarled trees seem older than they should be—knotted apple and ash that bear fruit long out of season. They grow in rows, though no one remembers planting them.

Elves and sensitive Hobbits may feel a kind of **warm melancholy** in these places, as though the laughter of children lingers in the grass, or a pipe’s scent curls through the fern.

**🧭** **How the Fellowship Might Discover Them**

- During their exploration of the ruins, the Hobbit may **notice unusual stone placement**, or feel “oddly welcome” near a certain tree.
- Goewen, attuned to quiet sorrow, may **sense a gentle resonance** in the land—memories not of battle, but of peace.

**✨** **The Meaning of the Memory**

These remnants serve no tactical purpose, hold no treasure. But for the Hobbit—especially one like Studs—they are a reminder of **where their people began**, and that even the smallest folk have left their mark on the wide, wild world.

“We were here, once. And maybe the land was better for it.”
