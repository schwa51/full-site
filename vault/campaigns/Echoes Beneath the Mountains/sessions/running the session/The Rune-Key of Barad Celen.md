## Summary
Given to the Fellowship by Balin, Son of Fundin, this rune-key is more than a tool—it is a symbol of an ancient alliance and a relic of forgotten trust between the Dwarves of Durin’s Folk and the Men of Arnor.  

## Physical Description
- A hexagonal tablet forged from blackened mithril, worn smooth with age. It is clearly dwarven made, but there is something notable about it- it is exceedingly fine work for a key, even one opening a treasured cache.  
- The reverse shows a complex mechanical notch pattern, crafted to fit a dwarven lock.  
- Suspended on a woven chain of copper and steel.
- Even Goewen recognizes something unique, even familiar.  

## Known Properties
- Unlocks the sealed cache within the ruins at the South Downs.  
- When near an ancient dwarven lock, the runes faintly glow and the metal warms.  
- Recognized by traditional Dwarves as a token of honor; grants +1 to Persuade or Courtesy when dealing with Durin’s Folk.  
- May resonate with other rune-keys or sanctified stonework.  

## Historical Origins
Unknown- found beneath the stones of Barad Celen  

## Narative Significance 
-Used to open Celebrimbor’s vault
