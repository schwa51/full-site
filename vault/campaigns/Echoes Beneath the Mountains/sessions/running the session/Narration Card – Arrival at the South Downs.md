As the final hill crests beneath your feet, the South Downs open like a sigh across the land—long green waves under a sky smeared with pale gray. The wind quickens, cooler now, and carries a scent older than dust and deeper than loam.  
  
###### Sight:  
Stretched before you, half-sunken in earth and ivy, are the remains of ancient stone walls—once proud and square, now softened by time. Columns lie where they fell. Moss spreads across shattered flagstones, and a weathered arch leans uncertainly toward the sky.  
  
###### Sound:  
There are no birds. Only the hush of wind through tall grass and the occasional groan of an old tree swaying on the slope. Somewhere within the ruin, a stone shifts softly.
  
###### Smell:  
A mix of living green and deep decay. The air is rich with moss, wet stone, and the subtle tang of rusted iron and long-cooled ash. It smells like time forgotten.  
  
###### Touch:  
The ground is uneven and giving, speckled with moisture. Fingertips brush the roughness of old carvings, worn to near-oblivion. A low damp clings to your boots and the cuffs of your cloak.  
  
###### Taste:  
The wind leaves a trace of mineral on your lips—chalky, bitter, and clean. As if the stones themselves exhale.  
  
###### Closing Line:  
There is a odd feeling here- you all sense it. Not malicious or evil, but one of watchfulness.
