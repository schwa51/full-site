## Lyrics

> ## Verse 1

Would you still wait, if time forgot your name?

Would you still guard, though none recall the flame?

You stood alone—long past the call,

But the war you kept was not yours at all.

## Chorus

You do not fall.

You are not lost.

This is the gift

Not the cost.

The shadow fled,

Your watch is done.

The oath you swore

Can be undone.

## Verse 2

Stone holds the truth when memory fails the tongue,

But song remains where all else has gone wrong.

Your hands were strong—your hearts were true,

But the burden now must not rest with you.

## Chorus

You do not fall.

You are not lost.

This is the gift

Not the cost.

The shadow fled,

Your watch is done.

The oath you swore

Can be undone.

## Bridge

No king will come to call you now,

But still you shall have peace somehow.

We speak your names beneath the sky—

And bid the oath-bound rest, not die.

## Final Chorus

You do not fall.

You are not lost.

The dawn has come,

Unbind the frost.

We hold the light,

Your task is done.

The oath you swore

Can be undone.
