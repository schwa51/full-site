# General Layout

The ruins were once a rectangular Arnorian watchfort, two stories high. Most outer walls have collapsed, forming irregular lines of stone and foundation. Only the eastern and southern corners remain partially intact. The interior is filled with rubble, moss, and broken stone.

# What Remains

## Collapsed Hearth and Ash-Stained Stone

A central hearth built into the south wall remains, half-buried in debris. Blackened stone, old iron cauldron rings, and moss are visible.  
Clue: The hearth conceals the entrance to the Dwarven cache. A successful Craft or Search (TN 16) may reveal the hollow flagstone.

## Friezes and Reliefs

Fragments of carved stone still show scenes of Men and Dwarves together. One depicts a tall Man shaking hands with a Dwarf beneath a star and mountain.  
Clue: Matches the rune-key motif, hinting at the alliance between peoples.

## Cairn of Stones

A simple mound of river stones tucked in a quiet corner, some stones more recent. A slate bears a faint carving of a sword and seven stars.  
Clue: Maintained by Rangers in recent centuries in honor of Captain Herion.

## Collapsed Stairs

A southeast stair leads downward but is choked with rubble. Moss-covered and partially buried.  
Clue: Leads to the Dwarven cache; can be cleared with tools or effort.

## Abandoned Scout Quarters (Ruined Alcoves)

Remains of four sleeping alcoves at the back wall. One contains a rotted pack and buckle.  
Discovery: The Hobbit PC finds Tomli Button's letter in a sealed oilskin satchel hidden behind a stone.

## The Wind-Sheltered Arch

A standing arch remains near the center. Inscriptions in Quenya and Sindarin read:  
“So long as oath is held, let none pass unbidden. Let only memory guide the hand.”

# Atmosphere

- The ruin is eerily quiet.  
- Faint whispers may be heard near the cairn or hearth.  
- Shadows linger just slightly too long, as if watching.
