_With a final turn of the rune-key, the stone floor gives slightly—not grinding, but yielding with the precision of masterwork. There is no sound of metal on metal, only the hush of displaced air._

As the hearthstone lid lifts, a **stone-lined chamber no more than three feet across and two feet deep** is revealed beneath. The inner walls gleam faintly—**pale stone veined with silver**, perfectly smooth, untouched by tool or time.

But it is the lid’s underside that halts breath:

**Inlaid in mithril**, fine as spider-silk and bright even in dim torchlight, is the **eight-pointed star of the House of Fëanor**—a mark **not of Dwarves**, but of the greatest of Elven smiths.

There is a silence.  
The **Dwarf**, frowning first, then stunned, mutters: _“No Dwarf made this.”_  
The **Elf** inhales sharply. She has seen this sigil only in the **eldest records of Lindon**, and only ever in reverent reference to **Celebrimbor** himself.

Resting in the vault are **three objects**, wrapped in aged silk and sealed with care, plus a small box:

**📄** **Contents of the Vault**

1. **Scroll of Sindarin**

- Written in an elegant, spiraling cipher—beautiful but unreadable at a glance.
- The script flows like poetry, but the pattern of symbols and spacing suggests **layers of meaning**, perhaps **encoded with numerical reference or dual script roots**.
- Only Goewen can read the surface language, but the **true message is buried**.

3. **Scroll of Khuzdul**

- Covered in **dense block script**, far more structured, almost **accounting-like** in its linework.
- Though the Dwarf PC cannot fully translate it alone, it appears to contain **cross-referenced notations**, possibly a **cipher key or crafting commentary**.
- Its presence—**in Celebrimbor’s vault**—is startling.

5. **Forging Template Sketch (Scroll)**

- A **vellum scroll**, partially unfurled, bearing a **diagram of a ring mold**—delicate filigree patterns surrounding an open band.
- Annotations in **Sindarin** note the alignment of core materials, reinforcing runes, and possibly power-channeling intent.
- It appears **unfinished**—or deliberately fragmented.
