# The Ring of Nyi

**Appearance:**  
Am ancient rings, dull with age yet faintly humming with thought.

**Lore:**  
Hold the memory of Nyi, a long-dead smith. Whispers invade the dreams of wearers, shaping their minds toward hers.

**Game Effect:**  
*Cursed.* Grants a **Blessing to Insight and Riddle**. On a Bout of Madness, Nyi seizes control temporarily.

**Notes:**  
Nyi knows secrets, including the spell to open the Citadel of the Ring-smiths.
