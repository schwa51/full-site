# 🗡 Combat in The One Ring (2nd Edition)

A quick-reference guide to the combat mechanics of *The One Ring*, suitable for players and LMs alike. Accurate to the core rules by Free League.

---

## ⚔️ Combat Round Structure

Each round is resolved in three main steps:

1. **Stance Declaration** — Each Player-hero in close combat chooses a stance.
2. **Action Resolution** — Actions are resolved by stance order.
3. **End of Round** — Handle ongoing effects, check conditions, etc.

---

## 🛡 Combat Stances

Player-heroes in close combat must choose a stance at the start of each round:

| Stance       | Order   | Who Can Attack You?        | Effects                                      |
|--------------|---------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Forward**   | 1st     | Any enemy                   | +1d to attacks, -1 Parry                      |
| **Open**      | 2nd     | Any enemy                   | Balanced stance, no modifiers                |
| **Defensive** | 3rd     | Only enemies in last group  | +Parry to defense, -1d to attacks             |
| **Rearward**  | 4th     | Not engaged in melee        | Ranged only. Requires 2 allies in melee.      |

## 🎯 Actions

Each character may take:
- **1 Main Action** (Attack, Combat Task, etc.)
- **1 Secondary Action** (Move, speak, draw a weapon, etc.)

### Main Actions Include:
- **Attack** — Roll Weapon Skill + d12 (feat die) + d6s (Skill rating).
- **Combat Tasks**:
  - *Protect Companion*
  - *Rally Comrades*
  - *Intimidate Foe*
  - *Prepare Shot* (Rearward stance)

---

## 💥 Damage, Wounds, Protection

- **Endurance**: If reduced to 0, the hero is Weary and collapses.
- **Piercing Blow**: Triggered on a 10 (or Gandalf rune) on the feat die.
  - Target must pass a **Protection Test** (Armor dice + d12) vs. weapon's **Injury rating**.
  - Failure = **Wounded**.
  - Two wounds = **Dying** (unless protected by Traits or Virtues).

### Equipment:
- **Armor**: Grants d6s to Protection rolls.
- **Shield**: Adds to Parry, may absorb a hit or be destroyed.

---

## ❤️ Hope and Shadow

- **Hope**: Can be spent to add your **Favored Attribute** to a roll.
- **Shadow**: Gained from dread, despair, lies, or misdeeds.
  - If **Shadow ≥ Hope**, you are **Miserable** and cannot use Hope.

---

## 📜 Additional Notes

- **Knockback**: May occur from monster abilities or failed rolls.
  - Costs 1 Main Action to recover position.
- **Magical Weapons**: Required to damage certain foes (e.g., Wraiths, spirits).
- **Special Creatures**: Some (like Elf-lords or Nazgûl) may take multiple actions per round or use sorcery.
