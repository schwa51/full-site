# 🗡 Combat in The One Ring (2nd Edition)

> 📜 *A guide for players and Loremasters alike. This reference condenses the rules of battle in Middle-earth as found in the Core Rulebook, faithful to the design of Francesco Nepitello.*

---

## ⚔️ Combat Round Structure

> 🕘 **Each round follows this sequence:**
>
> 1. **Stance Declaration** – Each hero in close combat selects a stance.
> 2. **Action Resolution** – Heroes act in stance order.
> 3. **End of Round** – Handle fatigue, injuries, and effects.

---

## 🛡 Combat Stances

> ⚠️ **Choose your stance wisely!**  
> Your stance defines when you act and how exposed you are in melee.

| Stance       | Order | Who Can Attack You?         | Effects                                  |
|--------------|-------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `Forward`     | First | Any enemy                    | +1d to attacks, -1 Parry                 |
| `Open`        | Second| Any enemy                    | No modifiers                             |
| `Defensive`   | Third | Only enemies in the last group | +Parry to defense, -1d to attacks     |
| `Rearward`    | Last  | Not engaged in melee         | Ranged only. Requires 2 allies in melee. |

> 💡 *Enemies do not declare stances, but are affected by yours.*

---

## 🎯 Combat Actions

Each round a hero may take:

- **1 Main Action** (attack, combat task, etc.)
- **1 Secondary Action** (move, ready weapon, speak)

> 📘 **Combat Tasks** (in place of a regular attack):
>
> - 🛡 *Protect Companion* – Guard an ally in the same stance.
> - 🎺 *Rally Comrades* – Restore Hope or reduce Weariness.
> - 😠 *Intimidate Foe* – Force an enemy to act with disadvantage.
> - 🏹 *Prepare Shot* – Required for ranged attack from Rearward.

---

## 💥 Wounds, Endurance & Armor

> 💔 **Combat wears you down in two ways:**
>
> - **Endurance Loss** – Reaching 0 = unconscious.
> - **Piercing Blows** – On a 10 or Gandalf rune (🛡), enemy forces a Protection Test.

### Protection Test
Roll:
- **1d12** + armor dice  
Fail = **Wounded**. Two wounds = **Dying**.

| Equipment | Benefit                            |
|-----------|------------------------------------|
| **Armor** | Adds d6s to Protection test        |
| **Shield**| Increases Parry or absorbs damage  |

> ⚠️ *Only magical weapons can harm certain foes (e.g., Wraiths, Spirits).*

---

## ❤️ Hope & Shadow

> ☀️ **Hope**: Spend to add your Favored Attribute to a roll.  
> 🌑 **Shadow**: Gained from dread, lies, and despair.

> 🔥 *If Shadow ≥ Hope, you become Miserable.*
>
> Miserable heroes **cannot use Hope** and may falter in times of need.

## 🧠 Loremaster Notes

::: gm
- **Knockback**: Some monsters or attacks force heroes back, costing their next Main Action to recover.
- **Special Foes**: Elf-lords, spirits, or creatures of the Shadow may act outside normal initiative order or cast sorceries.
- **Magical Success** (Gandalf rune): Often triggers special effects (e.g., automatic hits, insight, or resisting dread).
