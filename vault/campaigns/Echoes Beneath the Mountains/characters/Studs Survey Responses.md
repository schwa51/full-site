# Personal Roots and Identity

·       What was your home like before you took to the road?

I was widely discounted and not thought of highly. I never had any talents or skills of note and was generally overlooked. I was just another face in the crowd in a hobbit village of no renown.

·       Who was your closest companion or family member, and what became of them?

I raised geese, but poorly. They were my companions even they were stupid and stinky. I have dozens of siblings and cousins, but I was never anyone's first choice. They were content to stay in their villages. I don't think they noticed I was gone.

·       Why did you first leave your home? What did you hope to find—or escape?

I started visiting inns and pubs in other hobbit towns and found I had a knack for telling stories--and placing myself in the stories. I could reinvent myself however I wanted when I was away from home. Always gracious and courteous, I am also an excellent liar. No one expects cunning from such an 'unassuming and naive' hobbit. I found myself moving farther and farther from the heart of Hobbiton until finally I was feeling quite at home in border settlements like Bree.

# Secrets and Burdens

·       What lesson did your hero learn the hard way—and what did it cost them?

I was a cunning pickpocket. I took some severe thrashings on the rare occasion I was found out. This didn't make me more honest. It just made me better at convincing people that could stand to part with what I would otherwise steal.

·       What loss or regret do you carry that you rarely speak of?

I wanted to be a standard hobbit

·       What memory would you trade anything to forget?

No regrets. Nothing I'd take back. That would mean I'd be back to living my small, overlooked hobbit life.

# Loyalty and Patronage

·       What are your thoughts on Balin as your patron?

I haven’t thought much about him

·       Why did your hero choose to continue in this fellowship under Balin’s guidance?

I am more clever than any patron. I don't care if it's Balin or anyone else. I am always two steps ahead, but no one expects it because I'm just a 'silly, forgettable' hobbit.

# Shadows that Beckon

·       Your Shadow Path represents a temptation or weakness in your hero. When have you seen hints of it?

I can't remember what my shadow path is...sorry

·       What could push your character closer to falling into shadow?

He has convinced himself that he's invincible. He believes he's either too smart to get into real trouble or if trouble comes, he's too insignificant to be worth its while.

·       What belief, person, or virtue might keep them strong?

His unwavering self belief can also be a great strength to him. He is unfailingly optimistic and is very socially adept. He is slow to trust, but has a good sense of who he can trust.

# Light in the Darkness

·       What brings your hero true joy, even in hard times?

Riddles, stories, songs, and pipeweed. He's still a hobbit after all.

·       When was the last time your hero laughed from the heart—and who were they with?

He loves his crew. He is their jester and loves to make them laugh.

·       What would your hero fight to protect, not out of duty, but out of love?

His crew. Hobbiton--even if he doesn't intend to be there.

·       What is your hero most passionate about—even if they rarely show it?

Close-up magic.

# Ties to the Present

·       Who do you trust most, and why?

Flam. I understand his motives.

·       Who do you worry may not be ready for what lies ahead?

Our Ranger. He believes that by virtue of being a ranger he has certain skills. I believe those skills are earned.

·       How have recent events (like the resolution of The Silent Hoofprints) changed your perspective?

My team wants to fight even though it's not really in my nature. They're tough and ready. Maybe I should let them.

# Threads for the Future

·       Has your character had any dreams, visions, or strange feelings about the road ahead?

He has a good lucky feeling.

·       If you could achieve one thing on your journey, what would it be?

He would hear songs and tales from strange people from across Middle Earth.

·       If your tale were to be remembered in Bree or beyond, what would you want it to say?

Never could you find such a brave and resilient band. It didn't matter the odds, they always found a way to finish their quests.

# Known to the Fellowship

·       What parts of your past or story have you shared openly with your companions?

I never tell them about my past, my family, my village, or my insecurities. I always project confidence and fearlessness.

·       What do your companions likely suspect about you?

They are just like me: a brave face concealing a lot of doubt.

·       What nickname, reputation, or rumor has spread about you?

That I have an explosive temper and if someone provokes me I may snap and become quite dangerous. It's not true. I'm unflappable. I'm dangerous, but not in the way they are thinking. Instead I'll manipulate and turn others against you.

·       How do you think your companions perceive you—and how do you feel about that?

They see me as a mascot, sometimes in the way, but someone they would die to protect. Maybe they don't fully value me, but that plays right into my hands. I love being underestimated.

# Final Thoughts

·       Is there anything else about your hero that you feel should be part of their story?

He wishes he had the wherewithal to dress more splendidly. He believes his toenails grow too fast--and indeed they do. He found a shell once in Hobbiton, far from any sea. He always carries it in his pocket as a totem. He feels like he is that seashell.
