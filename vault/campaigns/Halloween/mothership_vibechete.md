# ðŸ”ª Vibechete!

## Scenario
Upstairs Corpâ€™s abandoned Hodder Forest Reserve Habitat drifts at the edge of Corespace, furnishing wealthy corporate scions a party spot away from their gilded cagesâ€™ ever-present surveillance.
Learning the domed habitat was recently condemned to the orbital scrapyards, you and your friends head over for one last shindig. Itâ€™s the anniversary of a mysterious accident that resulted in 50 workersâ€™ deaths and the parkâ€™s closure: urban legends swirl, hearts race...
Something stirs in Hodder Forestâ€™s depths.

## How Does It Play?

- **System & format:**Â _Mothership_â€”fast to teach, lethal when panic hits. Pre-gens, stress & panic, gear that matters.
- **Tone & pacing:**Â Tight spaces, hard choicesâ€”**hide, run, or risk a stand**â€”with sudden spikes of violence and a countdown feel.

## Themes & Table Feel

- Stalking predator, isolation, and industrial decay
- Limited light, dwindling options, and frayed trust
- Slasher vibes in a sci-fi shellâ€”loud alarms, quiet footsteps
