# ðŸ¦‡ The Count, the Castle, & the Curse

## Scenario
A storm rolls over a foreign land as your carriage stops before a looming castle. You remember the letter, the invitation, and thenâ€” teeth, and darkness. Now youâ€™ve awakened inside the Countâ€™s domain with the night pressing in and midnight drawing near.
