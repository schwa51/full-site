#  All Hallow’s Scream

##  Scenario {.rubric}
The Murder Mavens are invited to a lavish Halloween party at the flamboyant Vidal estate—home to a retired B-movie filmmaker and his adoring spouse, where Old Hollywood kitsch meets small-town gossip. Costumes, props, and cocktails abound… until a scream slices through the music and the doors stop feeling so welcoming. The party isn’t over; it’s just become a case.

## How Does It Play?

- **System & format:** _Brindlewood Bay_ one-shot; conversational moves (Day/Night/Meddling) gather clues, and the table uses **Theorize** to connect them into a solution.
- **Tone & pacing:** Social investigation in a crowded house—mingling, snooping, and heightened theatrics—shifting from charming to uncanny as the night wears on.

## Themes & Table Feel

- Costumes, celebrity nostalgia, and petty feuds with sharp edges
- Cozy-mystery vibe shading into eerie suggestion (no jump-scare reliance)
- Plenty of suspects, props, and rooms that invite roleplay and clue-hunting

---
## Why You Should Play
