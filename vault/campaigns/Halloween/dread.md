# ðŸ§± Dread {.smear}

##  Scenario {.smear}
It starts as a dare, or a detour, or a storm that forces you off the road. Doors lock. Radios die. The lights flicker as something moves just out of sight. You can try the smart thingâ€”the safe thingâ€”or you can reach for the one chance that might save you.
**Dread**Â is a tense horror RPG where every risky choice meansÂ **pulling a block from a tumbling tower**. The story tightens with each success, and when the tower falls, someone isÂ **out of the story**

## How Does It Play?

- **System & format:**Â Questionnaire-built characters; one-shot friendly; risky actions require a pull. No diceâ€”**the tower**Â is the mechanic.
- **Tone & pacing:**Â A steady ratchet from quiet unease to shaking hands; success raises stakes, hesitation courts failure, and catastrophe comes all at once.

## Themes & Table Feel

- Physical tension, silence, and nerves on display
- Isolation, bad options, and the price of bravery
- Sudden shocks amid long, breathless buildups

---
## Why You Should Play

- **Instant tension**Â with minimal rules- and a Jenga tower!
- **Perfect for Halloween:**Â compact, atmospheric, unforgettable
- **Memorable arcs:**Â characters defined by choices under pressure
