summary: A description of Narvi's Jewel
---

## Physical Description
A gem no larger than a chestnut, cut with unparalleled skill. It's body is a **deep, midnight blue**, and within it's heart run **silver veins** that shift in the light like flowing water. The jewel rests in a tiny inset **cloth-lined box**, crafted of cedar and silver, sealed with both **Elven script and Dwarven runes.**

## Inscription (Elvish, along the inner lid):
*"For the ring yet to be made--
To bind stone and starlight, flame and memory."*

## Historical Origins (revealed with great success)
This gem was gifted by Narvi to Celebrimbor in the Second Age. It was intended as the **centerpiece of a ring**--one that represent the union of **Dwarven Endurance** and **Elven wisdom**. It was to be a Ring of Accord, a Ring of Union and celebrate the best of both races. This was **a new ring of power**- one intended for both Elf and Dwarf. The ring would grant the wearer the hardiness of dwarves, the wisdom of elves, to be used to further works of enduring beauty and unite the races.

**Celebrimbor never forged it.**

When Sauron donned The One Ring and his deception was revealed, Celebrimbor hid the jewel and the notes he and Narvi had made on it's forging. Narvi and Celebrimbor were killed by the enemy and the peace between the elves and dwarves shattered by the deceptions of Sauron.
## Narative Significance
The stone and the accompanying lore will be greatly prized by Balin, likely leading him to go to Moria in search of Mithril for the forging of the ring.
