## Lyrics

# Beneath the Silver Leaves (Common Tongue)

<p class="dropcap">By voice of wind and starlit sea,<p/>

I sing of trees that shelter me.

Of silver bough and golden crown,

That shade the shores where stars look down.

In Lindon fair the birches gleam,

Like woven mist in morning dream.

Their roots are deep, their whisper old,

With tales of kin and kingdoms bold.

The holly’s green stands guard and true,

Though winter frowns and skies turn blue.

Its thorned hand keeps watchful eye

Where mountains meet the western sky.

O rowan tall and elm-tree wise,

Who reach with grace toward Elbereth’s skies.

I danced beneath their summer fire,

And carved their bark with Elven lyre.

But now I walk where shadows lie,

And trees are few beneath this sky.

Yet still I sing, though far I roam,

Of Lindon’s leaves — my heart, my home.

## Nu i-Dhíriel Lhuin

Mi laew a gail a dú na gîn,

Linnon i’galadh a lín en-in.

Telch lúin a rîs valthen lín,

Dannen or dúath, mi gwenneth gil.

Mi Lindon fael i’brethil naur,

Thîr mi thûl, lín henia aur.

Rîf lín dhîn, lín nad lín iaur,

Na ven a brannon, na dû i laur.

I’eglas calad, dagor narn,

Dan iaur lín i dhû thandarn.

Na mâb lín, gîl lîw thelir,

Mi echad lín, annûn cennir.

Na rovan taur a alph aen,

Telir am dû, tinnatha e-gwain.

Narnathon lín ned ‘laer na bel,

Na galadh lín teithannen mel.

Ach vi dûath i ven nín sí,

I’gelaidh glenn, ach lín guren mi.

Linnathon anann, lín rîf rîn,

Boe na Lindon — lín galad, lín.
