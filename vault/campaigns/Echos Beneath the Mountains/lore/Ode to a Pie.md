## Lyrics

## Ode to a Pie (and Other Friends)

Give me a pie and a pint of good cheer,

And I’ll walk to the end of the Shire, my dear.

But keep your dragons and treasure and gloom—

I’d rather have mushrooms and plenty of room!

I once met an Elf with a silver harp,

He offered me starlight (but it wasn’t too sharp).

I traded instead for a loaf and some cheese,

And a warm spot of sun with a soft summer breeze.

For breakfast is noble, and second’s divine,

Elevenses follows with apples and brine.

Luncheon’s a feast, and tea is a dream—

And supper, dear friends, is the crown and the gleam!
