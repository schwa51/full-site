## Lyrics

><p class="dropcap">I was born where the sun leans west on the hills,<p/>  
>Where the wind wears the scent of the straw and the steel.

>I dreamed as a boy of the kings of the Mark,  
>Of horns in the morning and fire in the dark.

>I rode as a man at the westernmost bounds,  
>My blade held the line where no others were found.

>The Lords called me Captain, the bold and the young—  
>And love found me then, when the songs had begun.

>But the fire came down in the Gap by the stone,  
>Orcs with white hands, and I fought them alone.

>My steed crushed my leg in the black and the flame,  
>But I held to the line my body searing and lame.

>I returned with no cheer from the one I had won—  
>She left me alone with the scars and the sun.

>So I fled from the light, and the honor turned shame,  
>And I wandered with none but one brother in name.

>This theft was the last, we had planned it that way—  
>To settle our debts, and walk into day.

>But you found us instead in the still of the wood—  
>And we give you our truth, if you'll make it do good.
