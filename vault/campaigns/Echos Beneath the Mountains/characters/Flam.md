## What the Fellowship Knows About Flam
***
<p class="dropclass">Flam is a richly equipped dwarf who claims to hail from a merchant family, though many in the Company quietly suspect that his skills in battle speak of a different past. He has never spoken at length about his upbringing, offering only brief comments about loyalty and friendship—values he clearly holds dear.</p>  
  
Among the Company, Flam is known for his fierce combat prowess, his boisterous toasts around the fire, and his unwavering loyalty to those he considers friends. While not quick to open up, he’s the first to step forward when danger looms, and he watches over his companions like a shield wall.  
  
He rarely speaks of orcs, but when he does, his hatred burns hot. The depth of that anger, along with the grim trophies of orc ears strung around his neck, suggest wounds far deeper than the usual Dwarven enmity. No one has asked, and he offers no explanations.  
  
Rumors swirl in taverns and among traveling dwarves: that Flam is the infamous “Orcsbane,” a warrior who once wiped out entire orc bands alone. Others whisper that “Ear Seeker” is a different dwarf entirely. Whether these two fearsome reputations belong to one dwarf or two, only Flam knows—and he isn’t saying.  
  
Whatever his past, one thing is clear: Flam is a hammer in the dark, and he will not let the Fellowship fall while he still draws breath.
