## Description

Bree-folk – Blacksmith’s Apprentice
<p class="dropcap">A wiry young Bree-lander with soot-stained fingers and restless eyes. Tobin has the look of someone who always feels too young and too old at once.<p/> He avoids direct confrontation, but his hands are skilled—and lately, he’s been carrying the weight of poor choices heavier than any hammer.
