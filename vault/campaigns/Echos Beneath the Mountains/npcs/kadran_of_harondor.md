## Description
Man of the South (Accomplice)
With oiled dark hair, finely kept boots, and an easy smile, Kadran blends charm with cunning. He plays the part of the agreeable traveler, helping with chores and trading talesâ€”but his gaze often lingers too long on things of value. A silver ring on his finger catches the light when he gestures. Is fiercely loyal to [[baran_the_scarred|Baran]]. Also see [[song-barans-lament.md|Baran's Lament]].
