## Situation Report

You combed the ruins for weeks with little to show but sand in your boots and a nasty heat rash. Last night, that changed: **Frazetta's team cracked the vault.**

Now the rendezvous with the client is set, and soon you'll all be blasting off with a hold full of booty ready to fence. All you've got to do is guard the escape craft and wait. Life really is sweet sometimes.

That's when the comms crackle to life. Frazetta's voice hisses through a storm of fuzz:

> _"Extraction from the lower tomb needed. Tanigawa's alive, but we won't get paid unless we get him out. Sending coordinates. **Bring bombs!**"_

## Mission Briefing

### Primary Objective

Rescue Tanigawa from the lower tombs and extract safely with the stolen goods.

### Operational Warnings

**EXTREME HAZARDS CONFIRMED:**

- Rival factions operating in the area
- Severe environmental hazards throughout the ruins
- Active deadly traps in the lower tombs
- **CRITICAL:** Sunray / Landis Expedition agents present. PCs must maintain concealment or risk immediate hostility.

### Required Equipment

- Explosives (mission critical)
- Standard breach and extraction gear
- Stealth equipment recommended

## Compensation

**Profit Share:** 10% of total artifact sale value

**Estimated Value:** 1 million credits per artifact successfully fenced through Tanigawa's contact.

**Potential Earnings:** Variable based on extraction success and artifact recovery. Previous team secured multiple high-value items before incident.

## Known Intelligence

### Confirmed Entry Points

- **Bore Hole:** Primary rappel point into lower levels
- **Entrance Hall:** Secret entrance to lower vault located at bottom of trench (restricted knowledge)

### Hostile Forces

Landing Party B is actively operating in the ruins:

- Survey Team members
- Sunray Intelligence Agents (armed and trained)
- Estimated 4+ personnel, likely more in support

### Environmental Factors

Weather conditions deteriorating. Time-sensitive extraction window.

## Operational Notes

This was supposed to be easy money. Guard duty while the real crew did the dangerous work. Now you're going in hot to pull someone out of a tomb that's already killed or scattered the rest of the team.

Frazetta doesn't say "bring bombs" unless things are **really** bad down there.

The good news? Tanigawa's contact is solid, and those artifacts are worth a fortune. The bad news? You're racing against Sunray intelligence agents, unknown tomb defenses, and whatever the hell went wrong down there in the first place.

Stealth is your friend. Get in, get Tanigawa, get the goods, get out. The moment Sunray or Landis figures out you're not part of their expedition, this job goes from "lucrative heist" to "fighting your way off-world."
