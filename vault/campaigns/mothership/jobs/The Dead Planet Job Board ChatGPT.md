## Situational Briefing

The *Alexis* was dispatched to investigate apparent **architectural anomalies** on the Dead Planet’s surface.  
Forty-eight hours after entering orbit, communications degraded into incoherence—fragmented logs mention “pulsing signals” beneath the planet’s crust and “echoes through the rock.”  

No further contact was established. Orbital scans show intermittent energy readings consistent with **partial reactor function**.

A previous BAS-Lehman drone attempt failed to re-establish contact; telemetry ceased after detecting **movement within the ruins**.

**Contract Status:** OPEN  
**Departure:** Immediate – Lexell Station Dock 3  
**Expected Duration:** 5–7 days
