## Contract Overview

**Employer:** MeirTech Corporate Oversight Division  
**Point of Contact:** Junior Executive *Chastain*, Oculus Oversight Officer

Oculus Research Station, orbiting the black hole **QLS-1A**, has gone dark.  
Your team is to board the station, assess the situation, and recover the **Final Research Report** before MeirTech’s fiscal review deadline. The corporation’s interests in nearby systems depend on verifying that QLS-1A poses no threat to future expansion.

> “Retrieve the data. Confirm operational integrity.  
>  Whatever’s happening out there — end it quietly.”

## Mission Objectives

### Primary Objectives
- Locate and secure the **Final Report** from the Oculus research database.  
- Re-establish communications with MeirTech HQ.  
- Assess the **status of station personnel** and any remaining assets.  
- Determine the nature of **“The Call”** referenced in recent transmissions.  

### Secondary Objectives
- Recover biological or data samples for MeirTech’s R&D division.  
- Evaluate the performance of the new **protective hull polymer** under radiation stress.  
- Avoid public disclosure of internal malfunctions or casualties.

---

## Compensation Package

### Base Pay
**50,000cr** total hazard bonus, payable upon submission of the Final Report.  
Additional compensation may be negotiated for intact data or live personnel recovery.

### Equipment & Support
- Access codes for the Oculus docking bay.  
- Clearance to operate under MeirTech salvage and reclamation authority.  
- Optional assignment of an internal security observer (Chastain liaison).

### Risks
The area around **QLS-1A** is subject to unpredictable gravitational flux and **intense radiation bursts**.  
Personnel may experience neurological symptoms colloquially termed **“The Call”** — characterized by paranoia, auditory hallucinations, and compulsion toward self-destructive acts.

## Known Personnel

- **Dr. Barnum** – Chief Research Officer; Station Commander. Believes QLS-1A to be a sentient entity.  
- **Dr. McClair** – Senior Research Officer; exhibiting severe psychosis. Attempts to induce “Embrace the Void.”  
- **Engineer Kellis** – Only partially affected; issued an SOS later overridden by command.  
- **Chastain** – Corporate Oversight; remains planet-side. Desperate for results.

> *Intelligence suggests multiple crew deaths and possible suicides attributed to “The Call.”*

## Operational Notes

- Expect degraded life-support and failing reactor controls.  
- Station corridors likely cluttered with debris, scattered research supplies, and unresponsive maintenance bots.  
- Surviving crew may appear lucid but are **unreliable** and potentially dangerous.  
- Timeframe critical — corporate transport convoys will enter the system within 30 days.

**Contract Status:** OPEN  
**Departure:** Immediate  
**Expected Duration:** 2–5 days (limited orbit window)
