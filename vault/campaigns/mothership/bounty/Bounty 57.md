### **Briefing**

Lera Zima, an independent journalist, has published several exposés against the **Spiritual Garden Society (SGS)**, a powerful faith-corporation operating from orbit above Ogroitum. Her reports feature interviews with disillusioned ex-members and whistleblowers, accusing the SGS of coercion and psychological manipulation.  

Her work, released via the *Ogroitum Inquest* newsfeed, has damaged the Society’s reputation and spurred families to question their involvement. The SGS claims her reporting constitutes harassment and defamation—and seeks to *“ensure this does not happen again.”*  

Zima’s investigation now extends beyond the Society: she’s been pursuing a story on **Albert’s Shipyard**, a shady dealer accused of selling unsafe vessels. Her trail has led her into deep space aboard a salvage ship, the *Emberjack*.

---

### **Warden Information**

Zima has chartered the *Emberjack* [Salvage Cutter J0C-III] and its four-person crew to follow the *Peapod* [Raider J1C-I], a ship recently sold under suspicious circumstances. They locate the *Peapod* drifting and unresponsive within an asteroid belt. Docked and investigating, the crew finds its interior a slaughterhouse.

An **intelligent waveform**—a sentient electromagnetic phenomenon—haunts the ship’s hull, moving through conductive materials and killing by disrupting neural activity. It cannot comprehend digital systems, but it directly actuates physical machinery and moves between ships through electrical umbilicals.  

Vaccsuits provide insulation and protection, but anyone exposed to the atmosphere is at risk. The *Waveform* becomes aware of thought and seeks to extinguish it, perceiving consciousness as unbearable noise.

**The Emberjack Crew**
- **Lera Zima** – Freelance journalist; determined, rational, unarmed.  
- **Petrus Lazar** – Pilot and captain; jokester, protective of his crew.  
- **Boele Lazar** – Engineer; dour, argumentative twin of Petrus.  
- **Cafer Wulfruna** – Salvage expert; radiation-scarred veteran.  
- **Syntyche Farrukh** – Teen apprentice spacer; naive and eager.  

If hailed, Syntyche answers the call—her first major job. When the crew boards, an umbilical connects the *Emberjack*’s command module to the *Peapod*’s habitation section, allowing the Waveform to cross over.

**Waveform Behavior**
- Initially dormant while the crew explores.  
- Activates once the intruders investigate the *Peapod’s* Command Module.  
- Only manifests in one room at a time but moves rapidly.  
- Targets open-air environments first, sabotages power systems next.  

Those in vaccsuits may outlast it, but insulation failure or decompression leads to quick deaths.

### **Consequences**

- **If Zima is silenced:** The SGS continues operating unopposed, granting the crew free access to *Paradise Domes* amenities.  
- **If Zima is saved:** She reframes the incident as a ship malfunction, exposing Albert’s Shipyard and driving it out of business. She continues investigating haunted ships in her spare time.  
- **If the crew does nothing:** The Waveform kills everyone aboard. It later reaches Ogroitum spaceport via salvagers, killing thousands.  

---

### **Notes for the Warden**

- The *Waveform* cannot be reasoned with or scanned—it reacts to electrical activity and conscious thought.  
- The *Peapod* is littered with clues to its spread (electrocuted crew, shattered consoles, psychic residue).  
- Ogroitum’s Step City offers no privacy: bounties, religion, and scandal all play out in public view.
