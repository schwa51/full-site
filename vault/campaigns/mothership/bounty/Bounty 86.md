### **Briefing**

The colony world of **Veldat** is a marginal venture—barely habitable, poorly supplied, and populated by aging colonists clinging to independence. Most of the locals make their living as *crabbers*, hunting the indigenous “fancy crabs,” a dinner-plate–sized species attracted to reflective materials.  

These creatures emerge at night to strip metal and glass from colony machinery, causing power failures and accidents. Bounties for their claws or eggs (400cr each) provide much of the colony’s limited income. Reidar Beech, once a reliable crabber, is now wanted for unpaid child support—and rumor has it he’s gone deeper underground, chasing higher-paying crab nests beneath Split Log.  

The locals at *Old Raindrop Inn* last saw Beech boasting of a big haul in “the deep tunnels.” He and his crew descended into the earth, promising to bring back enough eggs to make them rich.

### **Warden Information**

Below Split Log lies a network of massive, ancient tunnels—circular shafts four meters wide, once perfectly smooth but now filled with dust and debris. The upper burrows belong to the ordinary *fancy crabs*, but deeper still live the **bully crabs**—larger, territorial predators that steal from their smaller kin and attack intruders.  

No one has realized that the tunnels also contain **The Light**—a golden, floating orb of alien origin that consumes minds through sight. The Light’s victims remain functional but hollow, their bodies puppeted by the luminous intelligence within. Beech is among them now, his eyes glowing faintly gold.

#### The Light
A pulsing orb of heavy, fluid light—soft, golden, and mesmerizing. It appears playful at first, like sunlight through water. When seen directly, it invades through the pupil, traveling the optic nerve.  
- **Body Save** or be possessed.  
- If the eye is removed within minutes equal to Sanity, the victim may survive.  
- Once possessed, The Light takes over entirely, filling the mind with alien purpose.  

Reflections of The Light are safe to view, but its direct gaze converts the victim utterly. Beech now lures others toward it, pretending to lead them to safety while guiding them to their doom.

#### The Tunnels
- Perfectly round, 4.27m wide, straight for kilometers.  
- Silent *fancy crabs* stalk explorers, skittering at the edge of the light.  
- Bully crabs lurk deeper, attacking trespassers with immense claws.  
- The Light’s victims call for help, pretending to be survivors.  
- Eight converted colonists currently serve The Light.

### **Consequences**

- **If The Light is discovered and destroyed:** Beech’s body collapses, lifeless and empty. Split Log continues its uneasy existence.  
- **If The Light survives:** Beech and his fellow converts bring the entity to the surface. Within months, Split Log succumbs; within years, Veldat City follows. The Light’s influence spreads, reviving the ancient Vuenutian civilization that once annihilated itself.  
- **If ignored:** The tunnels slowly fill with followers. Split Log’s people vanish one by one, their eyes golden, their voices whispering in unison.
