### **Briefing**

Absalom Station was constructed as an orbital barracks and now houses tens of thousands of desperate settlers, each hoping to find work or passage elsewhere. Grimm is a member of the Vermin Patrol, a group tasked with hunting and exterminating infestations across the station. She’s known for her paranoid vigilance—checking every corner twice—which has made her one of the best at her job.

Recently, Grimm has gone missing. Her absence has been noted by coworkers, but none are willing to report it. Accessing their records or convincing them to cooperate reveals her quarters: Room 238, Pleasance Rooms—a decrepit former brig turned low-rent housing.

### **Warden Information**

Grimm borrowed money from Brandr Mulder to purchase a firearm, convinced she was being watched by mysterious figures she called “the Watchers.” The gun is gone, taken by these supposed Watchers, and Grimm has isolated herself in darkness—every light and screen smashed, her room meticulously clean. Her body bears surgical scars from black-market procedures; she is unknowingly hosting proliferating organic implants meant for transplant into unwilling subjects.

If approached gently, Grimm allows entry, asking if the crew can see the Watchers or “the things swimming inside her.” A failed or hostile approach triggers **The Change**—a horrific transformation brought on by panic and stress. Grimm’s body doubles in size, skin splitting to accommodate new muscle and claws. She flees into the vents, driven by fear and hunger.

If spoken to peacefully, the Watchers begin to observe the crew—eight covert operatives (six investigators, two scientists) monitoring the experiment. If Grimm transforms, the Watchers abandon the project, labeling it a failure and fleeing to report their findings.

### **Consequences**

If Grimm escapes into the vents, she becomes a predator haunting Absalom Station. At first, she’s dismissed as an urban legend—until the killings start. Eventually, a **new BL:4 bounty** is issued for *“The Beast of Absalom Station.”* Members of the Vermin Patrol are spared.  
Grimm heals by consuming flesh (1 Wound per human body equivalent).
