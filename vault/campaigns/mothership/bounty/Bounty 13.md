### **Briefing**

Balonov Downport City was once a thriving mining colony, now a decaying post-industrial ruin of rust, rain, and desperation. Beneath the city lie *The Bunkers*—a sprawling labyrinth of abandoned factories and smelters repurposed for illegal raves and hideouts for the destitute.  

Nuanix Biolabs reports that **Sample #78**, a bio-engineered organism, has escaped into this warren of decay. Tracking signals have located it deep within *The Bunkers*. It is large, fast, and lethally aggressive.

### **Warden Information**

**Sample #78**  
A dense orb of bone and iron scales from which 16 hollow spikes protrude, each roughly two feet long and resembling hypodermic needles. Hidden within each spike is a muscular “tongue” tipped with a rasp-like end. These tongues can shoot out over 20 feet, grip surfaces, and haul the creature forward—allowing it to lunge or climb at frightening speed (recorded at up to 50 mph).

When attacking, Sample #78 impales prey with several spikes, then extends its tongues to tear flesh away, anchoring its body atop the victim and consuming them alive. Its dense shell and unpredictable movement make it extremely difficult to neutralize without lethal force.

Unbeknownst to Nuanix Biolabs, Sample #78 is **gestating 14 offspring**. These will hatch within eight days, killing the parent and spreading rapidly through Balonov’s underground network.

**Stats:** [C:60 Crushing Spines 4d10 DMG I:60 AP:8 W:3(20)]  

**Local Complications**
- The Bunkers are dark, unlit, and partially collapsed.  
- Several *hunter parties* roam the tunnels (C:30 SMG 2d10 DMG I:30 W:2(20)). Some may offer to team up or attempt to steal the bounty once captured.  
- Toxic areas, acid vats, and radiation zones complicate pursuit.  
- The creature can easily navigate through vent systems inaccessible to humans.

### **Consequences**

- **If Captured:** Nuanix Biolabs offers lucrative future work in containment and biological recovery operations.  
- **If Not Captured:** Within days, Sample #78’s offspring consume all life in *The Bunkers*, then emerge to infest Balonov Downport City. Disappearances begin with pets, escalate to citizens, and culminate in a planetary-level infestation. A new corporate bounty may be posted for mass extermination.
