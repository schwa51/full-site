### **Briefing**

The ICIB has uncovered evidence of unlicensed AI development taking place aboard **Dautamica Station**, a privately owned orbital facility that rents research domes to those working in *proscribed sciences*. The station’s isolation, combined with its exorbitant rental costs, has made it a haven for unethical experimentation—from torture and viral weaponry to psychic warfare.

The crew is tasked with infiltrating Dautamica Station, identifying those responsible for **illegal AI research**, and recovering or neutralizing any active systems or researchers. The situation is volatile—most occupants could have their own bounties, and nearly everyone is armed, paranoid, and morally bankrupt.
