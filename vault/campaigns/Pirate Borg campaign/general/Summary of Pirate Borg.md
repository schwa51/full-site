# 🏴‍☠️ What is *Pirate Borg*?

**Pirate Borg** is a rules-light, grimdark pirate-themed role-playing game inspired by *Mörk Borg* and classic swashbuckling adventures—think *Black Sails* meets *Mad Max* on the high seas. It's a game of **rotting ships**, **cursed gold**, and **certain death**, where players take on the role of scurvy knaves sailing a doomed sea filled with monsters, undead, and dread pirate lords.

This is a game about:
- **Desperate pirates** with cursed pasts and violent futures
- **Apocalyptic seas** ruled by monsters and madness
- **Fast, brutal combat** and high character turnover
- **Treasure, betrayal, and naval mayhem**

## 🎲 How Does It Play?

**Pirate Borg** uses a minimalist D20-based system:

- **Core Mechanic**: Roll a d20 + modifier against a target number (usually 12+). You only roll for the player side—enemies deal static damage.
- **Characters** are fragile and fast to make, often dying spectacular deaths. But that’s part of the fun.
- **Classes** like the Haunted, Buccaneer, Swashbuckler, and Gutterborn Scum each come with unique abilities and terrible backstories.
- **Combat** is deadly, gritty, and simple. One good hit could end you—or your foe.
- **Loot** is weird and often cursed. Gold means survival, not retirement.

## ⚓ Naval Action & Ship Combat

The game includes full rules for:
- **Ship-to-ship combat** (based on monster-style stat blocks)
- **Action stations** (pilot, gunner, lookout, etc.)
- **Broadside attacks**, ramming, anchoring, wind direction, and movement
- **Custom ships**: capture or build your own sea-beast with guns and sails

*Limithron’s Guide to Naval Combat* (included with the game or as a free supplement) makes this both deadly and fun—with the ship treated like a monster and the crew like extensions of your will.

## 🐙 Why You Should Play

This game is:
- **Visually stunning**: The book is drenched in gritty, punk aesthetics.
- **Easy to pick up**: You can learn the rules in 10 minutes.
- **Creative and chaotic**: The world begs for player mischief and improvisation.
- **Brutal and flavorful**: Characters, treasure, monsters, and magic all carry consequences.

If you love pirate fantasy, grimdark tone, or just want to **die gloriously while cackling about the treasure you almost stole**, *Pirate Borg* is your game.
