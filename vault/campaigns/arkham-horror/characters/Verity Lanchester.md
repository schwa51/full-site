### Character Name: Verity Lanchester  
![verity.png](/static/img/verity.png)  
### Character Archetype: Seeker  
The seeker is a character who seeks answers. They gather knowledge, study facts, and leverage their accumulated learning to develop solutions to any problems they face. A seeker doesn’t have to be an ivory-towered academic, they could just as easily be someone with savvy street smarts. The important thing is that they rely on their brains, not their brawn, when dealing with a threat.  
A seeker is likely to be well-versed in all sorts of knowledge, including the esoteric and the forbidden. They tend to be good at searching for answers to problems and clues to mysteries, whether in a library or at a crime scene. And a seeker can be savvy enough to recognize that sometimes violence is unavoidable and prefer to be good at fighting from a distance. But more than anything, a seeker is almost always smart.

### Personality Trait: Cautious
A cautious character takes no unnecessary risks and ensures their actions always have the greatest potential for success. They go about their activities carefully, taking great pains to consider the dangers they face.  
When applied positively, caution ensures a character is deliberate and circumspect in their actions. They may act more slowly than others, but their chances of success are greater. When applied negatively, however, caution can quickly cross the line into cowardice. When someone thinks about the risks and dangers they face all the time, sometimes they become too much to discount.  
#### Positive:   
Your character may spend 1 insight to give themself advantage on all complex actions they perform with two or more dice until the end of their current turn.  
#### Negative:   
After being triggered, during your character’s next turn, they must spend half the dice in their pool to move directly away from any and all opponents by the most easily accessible and safest route. They may not spend dice to move closer to any opponent unless passing an opponent is the only way to flee.  
### Knacks:  
#### Tier 1: Scientific (seeker unique knack):  
When your character performs a complex action using Knowledge to conduct an experiment or scientific analy­sis, add 1 to the result of each die rolled.  
#### Tier 1: Brilliant Insight (seeker unique knack):  
When your character performs a complex action using Knowledge or Lore, if they roll two or more results of 6, your character or one ally within earshot may immediately regain 1 insight, to a maximum of their insight limit.  
#### Tier 1: Smart (general knack):  
Once per scene when your character performs a complex action using Knowledge or Wits, they may reroll one die.  

#### Tier 2: Empathic Mind (general knack):  
After spending several minutes interacting with another character, your character may perform a complex action using Intuition. If they succeed, they learn what motivations are driving the target and the truthful answer to one question your character asks that target.

### Background:  
#### Place of Origin:  
London, England  
At 10yr old, my mom was dying painfully of cancer. My father had died after being struck by a trolley when I was just 5, leaving my mom and 3 yo sister Hannah and 1yo brother John alone. My mom started getting sick a few years after my father died, but continued working as a bookkeeper to a prominent London solicitor until just a few months before she finally passed. I had prayed and prayed for a cure but didn't get one. I came across a book in a library I shouldn't have found (could come back to that later). The book made allusions to calling upon power from outside our reality. I managed to pray to Mother Hydra. The exact words I said were "Please let her live. I can't watch her suffer like this". The being interpreted this exactly- it let her live, without making any other changes. So she lives, but still feels pain, can be wounded, etc. She doesn't age and does slowly heal, but the pain from wounds, cancer, etc, still persists. 15yrs of this was too much, and recently she has started to go mad (could come back to this later). The "I can't watch her suffer like this" was also misinterpreted. It made it so not only can I watch it, I feel a compulsion to do so. Part of me loves it. This horrified me so much that I threw my life into healing the innocent and seeking knowledge of the arcane to undo what I had done to my mother and I. I became a nurse and have spent my life trying to atone for my mistake and to resist this compulsion. I have used my spare time to study the works of the arcane as much as I can- not as a mystic, but an amateur scholar, using the resources I have. Because of my past, of which I am ashamed, I am not that close to my fellow nurses. I am friendly with them, but reserved. They see me as a little strange and I never talk about my personal life. I am still close with my brother and sister. They know a little about our mom, but not why. We were taken care of by our mom’s aunt, who provided us with educations, allowing me and my sister to become nurses and my brother to become a banker.  
I currently work as a nurse at Guy’s Hospital. Recently we had a new patient come in who had clearly been experimented upon by someone with arcane powers. Given my efforts to seek atonement and interest in the arcane, I investigated and became trapped myself. When the scientist discovered my skill as a healer and the reason behind it, they used to me to heal their victims. This also stressed my compulsion to such a degree that now after so many times healing, I MUST cause or witness someone suffer. Hurting someone evil isn't enough. They must be undeserving of the suffering. This seems to be getting worse each time it happens.

**Flowing clothing- nurse outfit:** When performing a reaction to avoid a ranged attack, the wearer may reroll the result once.  
**Field surgeon kit:** 3 uses. When the user performs a successful complex action to heal damage, they increase the number of successes by two. If the user rolls one or more results of 1 while using this kit, mark one of the use circles. When all circles are marked, the kit can be replenished by purchasing $0.50’s worth of supplies.  
**Textbook- _The Principles and Practice of Medicine_ by William Osler:** The user may perform a simple action to consult the book in order to then perform a complex action related to that subject with advantage. The GM has final say regarding whether a subject is available in a textbook.  
**Magnifying Glass:** This optical device provides 10x magnification, opening the viewer to a world of tiny clues. It can provide a better look at various stains, smudges, scratches, marks, hairs, and more to reveal sights a keen, trained mind might be able to turn into useful information.  
**Lockpicks:** A wallet-sized roll of tools, a lockpick kit consists of several thin, flexible metal picks for defeating tumblers and tripping mechanisms within the keyhole.  
**Medium bag**  
**Belt and holster:** Able to holster a firearm and a single reload  
**Camera:** This high-quality, black-and-white camera is equipped to mount a flash camera suitable to mount a flash and takes print-quality photographs.   
**Dissection kit:** This kit rolls up in canvas. It has many of the same tools present in a field surgeon kit. It also holds a wide wide array of chemicals and cylinders for preserving and testing tissues and fluids to allow the user to gain information about a carcass or corpse.  
**10 rolls of film**: Each roll can take 6 black-and-white pictures  
**Survival kit:** Relatively small, this kit is often paired with a tarp, line, compass, Scout knife, hatchet, and bedroll. The kit itself contains waterproof matches, steel wool, some fishing line and hooks, and a small hand mirror, all within a 1-liter metal bottle with a tube and cup suitable for boiling clean water.
