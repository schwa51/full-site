# 🕯️ What is *Ten Candles*?

**Ten Candles** is a tragic-horror storytelling game: the sun is gone, the world is dark, and whatever *They* are… They’re out there. You’ll play the final hours of ordinary people trying to do something meaningful before the lights go out for good. Everyone’s story ends—but what you do before the end still matters. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🎲 How Does It Play?

- **Table & Time:** The game is played by the light of **ten candles**. Scenes advance—and the end draws closer—whenever a candle goes out. A full session typically runs **2–3 hours** with **3–6 players**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Core Resolution:** Players roll a shared pool of d6s; **any 6 = success**. 1s are lost for the rest of the scene. The GM rolls to contest **narration rights** (who describes the outcome), not to “beat” the players. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Who You Are:** Each character is defined by **Traits** (virtue/vice), a personal **Moment** (“I will find hope…”) and a hidden **Brink** (what you’re capable of at the edge). You can *burn* a card to push your luck; living your Moment grants a **Hope die** (5–6 succeeds). Embracing your Brink risks darkness—and can cost a candle. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Truths Between Scenes:** When candles darken, the table establishes new **truths**:  
  *“These things are true. The world is dark… And we are alive.”* :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

> **Important tone note:** *Ten Candles* is **tragic horror**, not survival horror—**no one survives the final scene**. The game is about how you face that ending. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## 🌑 Candles, Darkness & Fate

Expect **claustrophobic tension**, hard choices, and a steady march toward the last flicker of light. The system leans into **shared narration**, **escalating scarcity**, and the emotional arc of hope found—and lost—in the dark. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
