# üïØÔ∏è What is *Ten Candles*?

**Ten Candles** is a tragic-horror storytelling game: the sun is gone, the world is dark, and whatever *They* are‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre out there. You‚Äôll play the final hours of ordinary people trying to do something meaningful before the lights go out for good. Everyone‚Äôs story ends‚Äîbut what you do before the end still matters.

## üé≤ How Does It Play?

- **Table & Time:** The game is played by the light of **ten candles**. Scenes advance‚Äîand the end draws closer‚Äîwhenever a candle goes out. A full session typically runs **2‚Äì3 hours** with **3‚Äì6 players**.
- **Core Resolution:** Players roll a shared pool of d6s; **any 6 = success**. 1s are lost for the rest of the scene. The GM rolls to contest **narration rights** (who describes the outcome), not to ‚Äúbeat‚Äù the players.
- **Who You Are:** Each character is defined by **Traits** (virtue/vice), a personal **Moment** (‚ÄúI will find hope‚Ä¶‚Äù) and a hidden **Brink** (what you‚Äôre capable of at the edge). You can *burn* a card to push your luck; living your Moment grants a **Hope die** (5‚Äì6 succeeds). Embracing your Brink risks darkness‚Äîand can cost a candle.
- **Truths Between Scenes:** When candles darken, the table establishes new **truths**:  
  *‚ÄúThese things are true. The world is dark‚Ä¶ And we are alive.‚Äù* 

> **Important tone note:** *Ten Candles* is **tragic horror**, not survival horror‚Äî**no one survives the final scene**. The game is about how you face that ending.

## üåë Candles, Darkness & Fate

Expect **claustrophobic tension**, hard choices, and a steady march toward the last flicker of light. The system leans into **shared narration**, **escalating scarcity**, and the emotional arc of hope found‚Äîand lost‚Äîin the dark.

---

##  Why You Should Play

- **Instant atmosphere:** real candlelight shapes the table‚Äôs mood.
- **Powerful arcs:** Moments and Brinks drive memorable, character-first stories.
- **Collaborative horror:** everyone authoring truths keeps tension tight and personal.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety & Content

- **Themes:** dread, helplessness, stalking/pursuit, violence, body horror, sacrifice. 
- **Candle safety:** open flame is optional; if you use candles, follow the book‚Äôs safety guidance (use tealights, a fireproof bowl, keep clear space, and never leave them unattended).
