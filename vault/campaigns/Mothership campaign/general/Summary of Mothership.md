# ðŸ‘½ What is *Mothership*?

**Mothership** is a sci-fi horror RPG where you and your crew are deep-space professionals trying to survive in an indifferent, terrifying universe. Think *Alien*, *Event Horizon*, *Dead Space*, and *Sunshine*â€”with panic, body horror, and existential dread baked into the rules.

This is a game about:
- **Lonely survival** in the vacuum of space
- **Things that should not be** lurking in the dark
- **Fragile humans** cracking under pressure
- **Scavenging, sabotage**, and the terrifying unknown

## ðŸŽ² How Does It Play?

**Mothership** uses a simple d100 roll-under system:

- **Core Mechanic**: Roll under your stat + skill on percentile dice.
- **Four roles**: Team members are Marines (fight), Scientists (study), Androids (survive), or Teamsters (haul and fix).
- **Stress & Panic**: As things go wrong, stress builds. When it breaks? You panicâ€”scream, freeze, flee, or worse.
- **Character death is common**, but so are heroicsâ€”sometimes in the same scene.
- **Modules** (like *Dead Planet* and *Gradient Descent*) offer intense, often sandbox-style horror mysteries.

## ðŸš€ Ships, Crawlers, and Derelicts

Expect gameplay focused on:
- **Claustrophobic exploration** of derelicts, alien ruins, and research stations
- **Salvage gone wrong**, AI corruption, and xenobiological threats
- **Shipboard tension**: oxygen levels, reactor integrity, and whoâ€™s hiding something...

Every noise in the air ducts might be the last thing you hear.

## ðŸ§  Why You Should Play

This game is:
- **Quick and deadly**: Character creation in minutes, lethal outcomes in seconds.
- **Atmospheric and scary**: Pure space dread and lo-fi sci-fi vibes.
- **Tactical and tense**: Players must manage gear, stress, and limited knowledge.
- **Compatible and flexible**: Easy to hack, modify, and blend with your own scenarios.

If you love survival horror in space, *Mothership* is your nightmare playground.
