## Lyrics

> Beneath the fading trees I roam,  
> Where stars once sang of silver light.  
> The sea calls out, the wind returns—  
> My heart still lingers in the night.

> O flame of dawn, O voice once heard,  
> Your echo stirs in root and stone.  
> Though banners fall and gardens fade,  
> One name endures, though sung alone.

## Lore and Context

This song is believed to have originated in Lindon during the early Third Age. Some say it was composed by a minstrel of Gil-galad’s court, though others claim it is far older. The “Autumn Star” is thought to refer to Eärendil.
