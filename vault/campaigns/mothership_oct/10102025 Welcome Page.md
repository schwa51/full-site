## Welcome
Here's the [Mission Briefing](/vault/campaigns/mothership_oct/sessions/mission-briefing/)
 to bring you up to speed on our scenario for the evening. It contains a little background information and has links to the official Mothership app that allows for easy character creation for those so inclined, but also has a link to some pre-generated characters I'll also have available. (I highly recommend making your own character, even if you do it quickly that night). If you're a [Luddite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite), I have some bad news, the machines are here to stay, but there are still paper and pencil options! I'm including links to both [a pdf character sheet with a walkthrough on character creation](/assets/pdfs/Mothership_Character_Profile_advanced.pdf) and [a clean character sheet that's easy to use in play](/assets/pdfs/Mothership_Character_Profile_basic.pdf).

## Rules Overview
If you have some extra time (you managed to land that cushy government job that pays you not to work), I've included the official [Player Survival Guide](/assets/pdfs/Player-Survival-Guide-v1.2.pdf), and the longer [Mothership Rulebook](/assets/pdfs/Mothership-Zine-Rulebook-v5.pdf) but don't feel obligated to read it all or any of this; it's easy to pick up and you can just show up and we'll get along just fine.

### General dice rolling
Mothership uses d10s for all rolls in 3 different ways: adding the results of 2 die (for a result between 2-20), adding them and multiplying the result by ten (for a result between 20-200) or rolling a percentage die and 1d10 (for a result between 0-99). This last scenario is what you will roll most of the time, and you want to roll under your stat. There are a few ways to modify *Stat Checks*: **Advantage & Disadvantage**, **Critical Successes/Failures**, and **Skills**. **Advantage & Disadvantage** is easy- roll twice and keep the best (or worst) result. Most **Advantage & Disadvantage** is situational. **Criticals** are doubles on the percentage die roll (22, 55, 99, etc). If it's a success, it's a **Critical Success** and vice versa. **Skills** and a bonus to your stat depending on how leveled up it is. **Untrained- no bonus. Trained- 10% bonus. Expert- 15% bonus. Master- 20% bonus.** Most starting characters should have at least two trained skills and one expert skill.

### Character stats and how they are used
Characters have four *Stats*: **Strength**, **Speed**, **Intellect**, and **Combat**, representing how well they act under extreme pressure.
Characters have three *Saves*: **Sanity**, **Fear**, and **Body**, representing how resistant and reactive they are to different kinds of trauma and danger.
*Stat Checks* are made when you want to do something and the price for failure is high.
*Saves* are reactions, rolled to avoid different mental, emotional, and physical dangers.

### Final note from the Survival Guide on how to be a great player:
Mothership can be a very challenging game. You should expect:
- **Characters to die.** Play smart. Make the most of your time.
- **Violence to be punishing.** If you’re fighting, you’re losing. Violence is deadly, and should be avoided at all costs.
- **The odds to be stacked against you.** Rolls are punishing in Mothership. Find ways to stack the odds in your favor.
- **To make difficult choices.** Surviving the ordeal, solving the mystery, or saving the day are often mutually exclusive.
- **To pay attention.** Stay focused and plug into the fictional world. It helps you and everyone else get into the spirit of the game and have a more immersive experience.
- **A safe play environment.** This is a horror game, and it can deal with many uncomfortable topics. It’s your responsibility to make sure you’re not making anyone at the table uncomfortable with your words and actions (both in and out of character), and to speak up if you feel uncomfortable or if you notice anyone else might be uncomfortable.
