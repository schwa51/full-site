### Welcome
Here's the [Mission Briefing](10102025%20Mission%20Briefing.md) to bring you up to speed on our scenario for the evening. It contains a little background information and has links to the official Mothership app that allows for easy character creation for those so inclined, but also has a link to some pre-generated characters I'll also have available. If you're a [Luddite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite), I have some bad news, the machines are here to stay, but there are still paper and pencil options! I'm including links to both [a pdf character sheet with a walkthrough on character creation](/assets/pdfs/Mothership_Character_Profile_advanced.pdf) and [a clean character sheet that's easy to use in play](/assets/pdfs/Mothership_Character_Profile_basic.pdf).

### Rules Overview
If you have some extra time (like you managed to land that cushy government job that pays you not to work), I've included the official [Player Survival Guide](/assets/pdfs/Player-Survival-Guide-v1.2.pdf), but don't feel obligated to read it all or any of this, it's easy to pick up and you can also just show up and we'll get along just fine.
