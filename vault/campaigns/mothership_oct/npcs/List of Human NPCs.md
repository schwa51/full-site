## **1. MIKE (Missing)**
**Physical**: Mid-30s mining engineer with work-callused hands and the lean build of someone who spends time in cramped spaces. Dark hair always slightly mussed from helmet wear.
**Characteristics**: Was methodical and reliable until recently - the kind of person who kept detailed logs and followed safety protocols religiously. Before disappearing, he'd become increasingly anxious about water, especially showers. Left behind a cache with plant-misting supplies and a revolver, suggesting growing paranoia.
**Roleplay Notes**: When referenced, describe him as "the reliable one who always had backup plans" - his absence feels wrong to the crew [2][1].

## **2. DR. ETHAN GIOVANNI (Infected)**
**Physical**: Tall, lean academic in his 40s with pale skin and wire-rimmed glasses. Infrared goggles hang around his neck. Clean-shaven with thinning brown hair.
**Characteristics**: Methodical scientist who speaks in precise, clinical terms. Arrived with corporate authority and maintained professional distance from the miners. Now infected - appears calm and smiling, but yellow goo leaks from his mouth.
**Roleplay Notes**: Before infection: clipped, professional speech. After infection: unnaturally calm demeanor with that horrible smile. Never blinks enough [2][1].

## **3. SONYA (Team Leader)**
**Physical**: Compact, athletic woman in her early 40s with short-cropped gray hair and sharp green eyes. Carries herself with military bearing. Always has her keycard lanyard visible.
**Characteristics**: Natural leader who takes responsibility seriously. Practical problem-solver who reported the yellow goo but didn't panic about it. Has a collection of music cassettes - suggests she values morale and human connection.
**Roleplay Notes**: Direct communication style. Uses people's names when speaking to them. Gestures with her hands when explaining things [2][1].

## **4. ASHRAF (Breaker)**
**Physical**: Short and stocky with kind brown eyes and laugh lines. Often has rock dust under his fingernails. Younger than most of the crew, maybe mid-20s.
**Characteristics**: Optimistic and trusting to a fault. Collects small plastic toys and keeps a cactus - suggests he finds joy in small things. Eager to help and accommodate others.
**Roleplay Notes**: Asks lots of questions. Uses "sir" and "ma'am" frequently. Gets excited about small discoveries. Fidgets with his dice when nervous [2][1].

## **5. DANA (Head Driller)**
**Physical**: Tall, weathered woman in her 50s with calloused hands and a permanent squint from years of focused work. Keeps her graying hair pulled back severely. 
**Characteristics**: Professional and competent but emotionally distant. Religious (keeps a symbol in her quarters) with a family photo suggesting people she's working for, yet there may be some contradiction there as her clothes are mixed in with Kantaro's laundry. Takes her responsibilities seriously.
**Roleplay Notes**: Speaks in short, direct sentences. Rarely smiles. Checks equipment twice. Has a slight hand tremor from years of drill work [2][1].

## **6. JEROME (Assistant Driller)**
**Physical**: Very tall and lanky with an easy smile that doesn't quite reach his eyes anymore. Quick, nervous movements. Has a boyish face that makes him seem younger than his years.
**Characteristics**: Used to be the crew's comic relief but recent events have him on edge. Sleeps with a loaded handgun under his pillow. Tries to maintain normalcy through humor but it's forced now.
**Roleplay Notes**: Makes jokes at inappropriate times. Laughs too loudly. Keeps touching his hip where he probably has a concealed weapon. Avoids direct eye contact [2][1].

## **7. KANTARO (Loader - Infected)**
**Physical**: Powerfully built with broad shoulders and thick arms. Hasn't bathed recently - hair greasy, clothes wrinkled. Moves more slowly than his physique would suggest.
**Characteristics**: Naturally quiet and introspective, but now unnaturally still. The infection makes him avoid conversation. Has tissues with yellow goo in his quarters.
**Roleplay Notes**: Minimal verbal responses. Longer pauses before speaking. Avoids water completely - won't even drink in front of others. Stares at people slightly too long [2][1].

## **8. MORGAN (Loader)**
**Physical**: Average height with a soft build and a genuine, worried expression. Nervous habits like checking pockets and adjusting clothes. Has kind eyes but bags underneath from poor sleep.
**Characteristics**: Generally easygoing and friendly but increasingly anxious about the strange events. Secretly keeps extra supplies and stimulants stashed away. Loves the base cat Prince.
**Roleplay Notes**: Offers food or drinks to newcomers. Asks about Prince's wellbeing frequently. Laughs nervously when uncomfortable. Checks over his shoulder often [2][1].

## **9. RIE (Putter)**
**Physical**: Petite with sharp features and quick, darting eyes. Moves with economical precision. Has a mischievous expression even when trying to be serious.
**Characteristics**: Sarcastic wit as a defense mechanism. Uses recreational drugs (hidden in ceiling tiles) to cope with the isolation. Observant and notices details others miss.
**Roleplay Notes**: Delivers cutting observations with a straight face. Makes cultural references no one else gets. Fidgets with small objects. Smirks instead of smiling [2][1].

## **10. ROSA (Mining Engineer)**
**Physical**: Fit and athletic with confident posture and strong handshake. Keeps herself well-groomed despite the industrial setting. Has an intense gaze and stands closer to people than necessary.
**Characteristics**: Natural authority and expects others to follow her lead. Can be domineering but gets results. Takes charge in crisis situations. Has pin-up posters suggesting a bold personality.
**Roleplay Notes**: Stands with hands on hips. Makes direct eye contact that can be intimidating. Uses people's full names. Speaks with certainty even when unsure [2][1].

## **11. PRINCE (The Base Cat)**
**Physical**: Orange tabby cat with bright green eyes and a slightly overweight build from being well-fed by the crew. Clean except when avoiding baths.
**Characteristics**: Affectionate but independent. Brought aboard illegally by Morgan. Has the supernatural ability to see the invisible monster - will hiss, arch his back, and stare at empty spaces where the creature lurks.
**Roleplay Notes**: Purrs loudly when content. Follows people around looking for attention. When the monster is near: sudden stillness, dilated pupils, fur standing up, staring at specific spots while backing away slowly [2][1].
