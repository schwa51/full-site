If damaged, the monster will retreat to its pod in the MINE ANTECHAMBER (9), where it will remain for 10 minutes of real time as the YELLOW GOO repairs its injuries (healing its Health, but
not its Hits).
Anyone who comes into direct contact with the Yellow Goo must make a Body Save at Disadvantage or have their biology slowly rewritten from the inside as the Yellow Goo attempts to "heal" them. The first sign of the change is an aversion to water. The victim regains all Health and gains advantage on Strength checks. However, in 2d10 hours they will start to melt, losing 1d10 Health every 10 minutes until they turn into a puddle of Yellow Goo.
