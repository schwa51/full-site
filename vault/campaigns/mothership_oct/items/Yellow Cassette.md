# 📼 Yellow Cassette

**Label:**  
Unmarked

**Condition:**  
Tape slightly warped, inconsistent spooling.

**Audio Log:**  
> “This is Mike. I’m not... I’m not ok, something is wrong.  
> The water... I don’t know. I… I can’t stay up here for long.  
> I broke the shower, I told Sonya it was an accident, but... it’s the water,  
> I don’t think it likes the water... I’m going back into the mine.  
> I need quiet. Oh God, I don’t know... please fix me... I don’t... I don’t know what’s happening...”

**Notes:**  
- Speaker identified as *Mike* (missing crew member).  
- Mentions *Sonya* — link to blue cassette.  
- Recurring reference: “the water.”  
- Last section degraded; background static increases sharply.
