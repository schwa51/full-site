# 🕯️ What is *Shadowdark*?

**Shadowdark** is fast, dangerous, and elegantly old-school: crawl through ruin and cavern in search of gold and glory while the dark presses in. It’s a rules-light fantasy RPG built for quick decisions, lethal combat, and clever play. In this game, even your **torch burns in real-world time**—when the light goes, so does your luck.

Expect spider-haunted halls, forgotten cities, and dragon lairs—anywhere “danger and darkness hold sway.”

## 🎲 What to Expect (System Feel, no spoilers)

- **Quick rulings, real peril.** The core loop is simple: describe actions, roll when risk is real, keep moving. Checks are **d20 vs. a DC** set by the GM; advantage/disadvantage applies when it matters. Death is on the table.
- **Classic classes.** Fighters, Thieves, Priests, and Wizards—each sharp and straightforward, with talents and spells that escalate as you level.
- **Time & light matter.** Torches last **one hour of real time**; delay invites consequences. 
- **Movement & turns that hum.** Clear turn/round cadence; move about a **near** distance (≈30 ft) on your turn.

## Themes & Table Vibe

- **Into the unknown:** exploration, mapping, and hard choices under pressure.
- **Risk for reward:** treasure, secrets, and the thrill of getting out alive.
- **The dark is an enemy:** dwindling light, mounting wounds, and a world that fights back.
