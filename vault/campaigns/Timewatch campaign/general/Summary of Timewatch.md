# ‚è±Ô∏è What is *TimeWatch*?

**TimeWatch** is a time-traveling investigative RPG powered by the GUMSHOE system. Players are elite chronal agents protecting history from paradoxes, temporal invaders, and butterfly effects gone rogue. Think *Doctor Who* meets *Men in Black* with a dash of *The Time Machine* and *Edge of Tomorrow*.

This is a game about:
- **Fixing broken timelines** and undoing sabotage
- **Fighting temporal threats** like psychic velociraptors and rogue time travelers
- **Smart investigation** with clever uses of chronotech
- **Causality chaos**, time loops, and alternate selves

## üé≤ How Does It Play?

**TimeWatch** uses the **GUMSHOE** investigative system:

- **Investigative Abilities** auto-succeed if you have the right skill. The tension lies in *what you do* with the clue.
- **General Abilities** use a d6 + points spend. Roll high to succeed (usually 8+).
- **Chronal abilities** like Paradox Prevention and Reality Anchor help you stay sane and unravel twisted time plots.
- **Preparedness** lets you retroactively decide you packed the right gadget‚Äîa perfect match for temporal agents.
- **Stitches** are the narrative currency for teamwork, bold moves, and timeline manipulation.

## üåÄ Temporal Shenanigans

TimeWatch excels at:
- **Time travel tricks** like jumping back mid-scene to plant evidence or rescue yourself
- **Causality puzzles** where the *effect* might appear before the *cause*
- **Timeline reboots**, memory wipes, splintered realities, and paradox predators

Missions often hop between centuries, empires, and critical turning points in history.
