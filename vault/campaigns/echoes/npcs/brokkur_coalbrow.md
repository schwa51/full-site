## Description
Dwarf of the Blue Mountains
<p class="dropcap">Stocky and soot-streaked even on the road, Brokkur is a smith traveling with Faldur to display his crafted works in Dale.</p> Gruff and direct, he has little patience for suspicion cast on his folk, and his instinct is to speak loudly and carry a heavy hammer.
