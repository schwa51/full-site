# Personal Roots and Identity

·       What was your home like before you took to the road?

I lived in an elven trading village where various other species came to trade for elven goods.  
It was a small village of only a dozen permanent residents, all elves, and we were the public face for the elven tribe.  
The elves all thought we were a bit… eccentric… because we volunteered to live out there and interact with everyone,  
but we loved it. I spent 175 or so years there and picked up a ton of useful knowledge about healing and lore.  
Radaghast came with some frequency and enjoyed teaching me things, and I developed a love of learning,  
studying the other species, and a desire to figure out why they are the way they are. The village is Forest’s Edge.

·       Who was your closest companion or family member, and what became of them?

My older sister, Elara. She’s alive, still living in the village last I knew.

·       Why did you first leave your home? What did you hope to find—or escape?

I left about 37 years ago, driven by my thirst for knowledge and leaving in the night shortly after my adulthood ceremony. I left to find a place that would accept me, but also to learn about why people (generally) are the way they are.

# Secrets and Burdens

·       What lesson did your hero learn the hard way—and what did it cost them?

That elves can be just as cruel, mean, and destructive as every other species, if not worse. I learned this in my memory (outlined below). The cost was- I suppressed my emotions largely and decided to run on pure logic. It also was the catalyst for me to leave.

·       What loss or regret do you carry that you rarely speak of?

I was stripped of my right to leave via the Gray Havens by the king of my tribe due to how “unelven” I am.

·       What memory would you trade anything to forget?

Going to stand before the King of our elven tribe on my “congrats you are an adult” day and being ridiculed for being “eccentric” by him and his court when I turned 150, and having all possible suitors reject me because I wasn’t a “traditional” elf. The king also said I could never leave via the Gray Havens.

# Loyalty and Patronage

·       What are your thoughts on Balin as your patron?

I have mixed feelings

·       Why did your hero choose to continue in this fellowship under Balin’s guidance?

I didn’t want to leave my test subjects behind. It’d be a lot of work to find a new group of shorter-lived species to integrate myself in, again.

# Shadows that Beckon

·       Your Shadow Path represents a temptation or weakness in your hero. When have you seen hints of it?

At night, when it’s just me and my thoughts.

·       What could push your character closer to falling into shadow?

Realizing that I don’t belong… anywhere.

·       What belief, person, or virtue might keep them strong?

Elara, my sister, has been unfailing in her support for me. Also, good interactions with the fellowship.

# Light in the Darkness

·       What brings your hero true joy, even in hard times?

Doing good for people. I live by the Elven proverb of “A forest is only as strong as its roots” and that as we strengthen the roots, it benefits everyone.

·       When was the last time your hero laughed from the heart—and who were they with?

The day before my adulthood ceremony when my parents, Elara, and myself held a celebration in our home.

·       What would your hero fight to protect, not out of duty, but out of love?

My family

·       What is your hero most passionate about—even if they rarely show it?

Knowledge, the pursuit of knowledge, and enduring others know the knowledge.

# Ties to the Present

·       Who do you trust most, and why?

Studs Terkel, because he has such a love for life and is motivated by good reasons

·       Who do you worry may not be ready for what lies ahead?

John’s ranger (I can’t remember his name) because he’s pretending to be a Ranger for selfish reasons.

·       How have recent events (like the resolution of The Silent Hoofprints) changed your perspective?

Well, they certainly haven’t made me more confident in John’s Ranger because he couldn’t even detect tracks. Otherwise, my beliefs that Alex and John both are really after loot has been… more affirmed, so I’m probably internally distraught over what I view are “bad” motives for working with Balin.

# Threads for the Future

·       Has your character had any dreams, visions, or strange feelings about the road ahead?

No. My worries are more about what is going to happen because we ignored the other patron, Aragon’s mother. What is going to get stronger because we ignored it?

·       If you could achieve one thing on your journey, what would it be?

Just generally helping improve the lives of those we meet.

·       If your tale were to be remembered in Bree or beyond, what would you want it to say?

That I did good for all, and helped make Bree a better place, not for glory, but because it’s the right thing to do.

# Known to the Fellowship

·       What parts of your past or story have you shared openly with your companions?

Just the fact that I love research, I lived in a trading town, details about my family, people I encountered there, etc., but nothing about why I left besides something generic like “I wanted to come out and learn more about other species.”

·       What do your companions likely suspect about you?

That I didn’t leave by choice necessarily, I left because I didn’t belong.

·       What nickname, reputation, or rumor has spread about you?

I think they think I’m an odd duck- I’m not motivated by treasure, I love to help people for no reward, and I’m mostly unemotional, so I’m just a weirdo. But they also know I have their back, and will do anything for them.

·       How do you think your companions perceive you—and how do you feel about that?

Nothing yet?

# Final Thoughts

·       Is there anything else about your hero that you feel should be part of their story?

I know a LOT of people from the trading village, so it feels like maybe we run into someone I knew from there.
