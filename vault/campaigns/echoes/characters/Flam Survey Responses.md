# Personal Roots and Identity

·       What was your home like before you took to the road?

Dark and scary. Always scrapping for food and fighting

·       Who was your closest companion or family member, and what became of them?

My imaginary friend Boin

·       Why did you first leave your home? What did you hope to find—or escape?

I got old enough to realize my 'parents' were blind orcs that thought I was one of theirs when I was an infant.

# Secrets and Burdens

·       What lesson did your hero learn the hard way—and what did it cost them?

Not to trust every dwarf I meet. I lost my favorite knife and left ear

·       What loss or regret do you carry that you rarely speak of?

My real parents. Embarrassed to be raised by my mortal enemies who fought more than dwarves normally do.

·       What memory would you trade anything to forget?

My entire childhood. Especially the female orc I had a crush on

# Loyalty and Patronage

·       What are your thoughts on Balin as your patron?

I respect him but don’t know him well yet

·       Why did your hero choose to continue in this fellowship under Balin’s guidance?

I need to find my way as a dwarf and want to found my own kingdom because I don't fit in with other dwarves.

# Shadows that Beckon

·       When have you seen hints of your Shadow Path?

I killed my orc foster parents when I found out they took me as a kid without knowing I was a dwarf

·       What could push your character closer to falling into shadow?

Orcs defeating my friends or not dying in combat

·       What belief, person, or virtue might keep them strong?

Friends keeping me level headed in combat and not going into a blood rage

# Light in the Darkness

·       What brings your hero true joy, even in hard times?

Ale, celebrations for any reason at all, and true friends

·       When was the last time your hero laughed from the heart—and who were they with?

Telling stories with the current fellowship about trying to set up the scarred horse thief with the ugliest woman in town

·       What would your hero fight to protect, not out of duty, but out of love?

Friends

·       What is your hero most passionate about—even if they rarely show it?

Friendship, hard to show because of the broken trust with family in the past

# Ties to the Present

·       Who do you trust most, and why?

Damirror, he is quiet and calculating. Those who talk too much have something to hide

·       Who do you worry may not be ready for what lies ahead?

Studs Terkel. Too innocent and friendly

·       How have recent events (like The Silent Hoofprints) changed your perspective?

People can change and some deserve a second chance

# Threads for the Future

·       Has your character had any dreams, visions, or strange feelings about the road ahead?

Nope, only nightmares about the past. Anything is better than what I have been through

·       If you could achieve one thing on your journey, what would it be?

Finding a home where I truly belong.

·       If your tale were to be remembered in Bree or beyond, what would you want it to say?

Flam is the fiercest and most just warrior to pass through town

# Known to the Fellowship

·       What parts of your past or story have you shared openly with your companions?

I have shared very little with them. They mostly know that I'm very loyal to those I consider friends and that I value friendship above all else. I fear sharing because I believe that learning that I have been raised by orcs would cause anyone of sound mind to turn on me instantly

·       What do your companions likely suspect about you?

They suspect I am not from the family I claim. I claim to be from a merchant family but my fighting skills far surpass what any merchant would ever learn. They also suspect that my hatred for orcs runs deeper than the usual dwarfish-orc feud but I refuse to speak on the matter.

·       What nickname, reputation, or rumor has spread about you?

There is a rumor that I have slaughtered multiple tribes of orcs singlehandedly which has resulted in the nicknames 'orcsbane' and 'ear seeker'. Some rumors suggest each of those names belong to two different dwarves, but only I know the truth

·       How do you think your companions perceive you—and how do you feel about that?

I think they see me as a rich dwarf with the sole purpose of making my name well known and my fighting skills back it up which makes me proud. They also see how loyal I am to the group and that is what I strive to make most well known.

# Final Thoughts

·       Is there anything else about your hero that you feel should be part of their story?

The orc ears I have as a necklace are actually the orc family that raised me
