## [N1] Crown District – *The Melancholy Crown*
**Goewen:** Feels the weight of absence in the wind. Her senses echo with the cadence of long-lost speeches and formal song. The broken moon-tower's silhouette stirs a pang of ancestral pride and mourning.  
**Damirror:** Notes that this high vantage offers both danger and opportunity. He scans instinctively for line-of-sight paths and movement across the ruins.  
**Flam:** His eye is drawn to the architecture — massive stones placed with almost Dwarvish precision. He spits unconsciously; Elven grace, he thinks, crumbled easily enough.  
**Studs:** Clutches his pack a little tighter. The openness makes him feel exposed, but he also stares wide-eyed at the cracked amphitheatre, imagining stories once told here.

---

## [N2] Ashen Garth – *The Veiled Garth*
**Goewen:** The unnatural stillness feels holy and haunting. The preservation here is no accident. She walks as though entering a sacred bower.  
**Damirror:** Notes that the ground is undisturbed — too undisturbed. A scout’s instinct tells him something is either watching, or long gone but dangerous.  
**Flam:** Frowns at the cracked temple, muttering about the folly of Elven worship. But his gaze lingers on the still fountain, uneasy.  
**Studs:** Is captivated by the light and silence. He almost hums a tune, then stops himself, the hush too complete.

---

## [N3] Vaultward Steps – *The Broken Hand*
**Goewen:** Kneels near the collapsed forge. The metal whispers to her — not literally, but in memory. She brushes soot like a mourner.  
**Damirror:** Catches the glint of buried iron and crouches low — someone worked here after the fall. Scavengers? Or guardians?  
**Flam:** Stops mid-step. His breath catches. He removes his gloves and presses a hand to the stone anvil as if greeting an old friend left to ruin.  
**Studs:** The rhythmic sound unnerves him. He mutters about “not liking ghost hammers” and sticks close to the center of the group.

---

## [N4] Riverfall Market – *The Hollow Commons*
**Goewen:** Finds herself tracing the faded trade creeds carved into the stone. Her fingers know the words before her lips form them.  
**Damirror:** Steps carefully over scattered goods, noting crushed footprints — not theirs. Someone came through in haste.  
**Flam:** Tests the sturdiness of the Grand Stair. His instincts say this was once a defensible hub — now a deathtrap.  
**Studs:** Picks up a cracked, old apple carving and pockets it without thinking. “Waste not,” he says, eyes darting warily.

---

## [N5] Gemstreet & Vault Ends – *The Shattered Hearth*
**Goewen:** Touches a vine overtaking the mural — it crumbles slightly. Her gaze lingers on the garden, her voice caught between grief and curiosity.  
**Damirror:** Eyes the half-burned campfire and drops to one knee. It’s recent. He brushes ash with practiced fingers, guessing how many days since it went cold.  
**Flam:** Scowls at the villas. “Jewels and gardens while war brewed beyond their walls,” he mutters. But his hand unconsciously rests on his axe.  
**Studs:** Is drawn to a cracked mosaic in the courtyard. He wipes it gently with a sleeve. “Someone lived here once,” he whispers, as if to himself.

---

## [N6] The Fractured Watch – *The Hollow Gate*
**Goewen:** Her eyes trace the ruined towers. She recalls tales of when the Watchfire Circle lit the sky. She wonders if it ever truly kept them safe.  
**Damirror:** Runs a hand along a vine-draped spear. Still sharp. This place has been reclaimed, but not forgotten.  
**Flam:** Stares at the breach with clenched fists. “They fought here,” he growls. “And someone ran.” He isn’t angry — he’s grieving.  
**Studs:** Shivers at the silence. He places a single small rock atop a rusted helm, the way his uncle taught him to mark a grave.

---

## [N7] Watershade District – *The Murmuring Vein*
**Goewen:** Watches the water ripple and reflect. The distortions fascinate her — like glimpsing another world through broken memory.  
**Damirror:** Eyes the canal, notes the slippery footing. He plots potential exits. The scents confuse him, floral and rot in equal measure.  
**Flam:** Snorts at the smell. But the wine vaults… those interest him more than he’d admit.  
**Studs:** Nearly slips on the wet stones. He swears quietly and mutters, “Not dying in a wine cellar, thank you very much.”

---

## [N8] Artisan Residences – *The Quiet Ash*
**Goewen:** Kneels at a scattered box of sculptor’s tools. She rights them, delicately, as if they could still be used.  
**Damirror:** Moves silently, scanning doorways and courtyards. These homes were left in haste. He’s sure of it.  
**Flam:** Picks up a toy hammer, stares at it, then gently sets it beside a hearth. His face is unreadable.  
**Studs:** Finds a half-sung lullaby etched into a wall. He reads it aloud softly, voice faltering. “This was a home,” he says.

---

## [N9] Cradle of Memory – *The Forgotten Steps*
**Goewen:** Her fingers trace Elven poetry inscribed into the walls. She murmurs it softly, even as Dwarven annotations interrupt the meter.  
**Damirror:** Notes a strange alignment of symbols and spiral paths. This place was designed to be remembered.  
**Flam:** Laughs once — harsh and short — at the Dwarven script, but falls silent as he reads it through.  
**Studs:** Is awed by the view. He doesn’t speak. He just stands there, still, like he belongs for a moment.

---

## [N10] Ghosted Lane – *The Edge of Echoes*
**Goewen:** Stares at the Wyr-tree, uncertain whether to kneel or draw her blade. It feels like something is missing — or waiting.  
**Damirror:** Freezes at the claw marks. Something came through here. Something not afraid of Elven ruins.  
**Flam:** His hand goes to his axe without thought. “Whatever made those,” he says, “I’d like to meet it — once.”  
**Studs:** Hugs the wall, eyes darting. “No birds, no mice, no thank you.”
