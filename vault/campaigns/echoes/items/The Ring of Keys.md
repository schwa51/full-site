# The Ring of Keys

> *“A heavy ring, hung with countless ornate keys, entrusted by Durin’s line to guard the very doors of Khazad-dûm.”*

---

## Description
This huge ring of keys is a **magic item in its own right**. Dozens of ornate keys hang from a perfect circle of **mithril**. Each key corresponds to a great door of the Dwarrowdelf.  

The enchantment of **opening and returning** ensures:  
- The correct key is always at hand.  
- The ring cannot be lost or stolen: if taken, it reappears later in the possession of its rightful bearer.  
- It can only be surrendered willingly, or taken from the bearer upon their death.  

Additionally, peering through the mithril circle reveals **hidden doors and compartments** — the ring bears a *Blessing of Scan*.  

---

## Story
In vision, Goewen ‘remembered’ the King entrusting them with a **heavy ring of keys** and a **small black pouch**, moments before the doom of Durin VI fell upon the hall.  

Recovered from the **tomb of Náin I**, Goewen became the new **Key-bearer**, bound to its legacy.  

---

## Powers
- Unlocks all Doors of the Dwarrowdelf.  
- Always provides the correct key.  
- Cannot be lost or stolen (returns to bearer).  
- Reveals hidden doors and compartments (*Blessing of Scan*).

## Keyed Doors
Among the doors opened by the Ring of Keys:  

- **The East-gate** — a large, heavy iron key, very old and solid.  
- **The Dimrill Door** — a small mithril key, etched with the number *17*.  
- **The Secret Cleft** — a mithril key marked with the *crown of Durin*.  
- **The Vault of Uruktharbun** — an ornate key with a golden handle.  
- **The Armouries of the Third Deep** — a steel key marked with crossed axes.  
- **The City Gate** — similar to the East-gate key, but newer in design.  
- **The Citadel of the Ring-smiths** — not a key at all: the Ring of Keys itself counts as a **magic ring**.

## Notes
- The bearer is known as the **Key-bearer of Khazad-dûm**.  
- The small black pouch entrusted with the keys has not yet revealed its secret…
