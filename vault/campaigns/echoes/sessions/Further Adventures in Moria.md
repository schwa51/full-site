- They became turned around and stumbled into a **deserted Orc den** tainted with foul air.  
  - All but Goewen failed to resist the corruption and would lose **1d6** on their next test.  
- No sign of Orcs was found in this area.  

---
### Day 2
- The Company faced *The Deadly Dark*. Damirror was wounded, and *Eye Awareness* rose to **9**.  
- Fortune soon balanced misfortune: they discovered *The Right Way*, allowing swift progress.  
- Orc presence remained uncertain.  

---
### Day 3
- Goewen healed Damirror of his wound.  
- Thanks to *The Right Way*, the Company gained a **free 10 miles** of travel.  

---
### Day 4
- A day of steady travel, narrowly missing another encounter with *The Deadly Dark*.  
- No clear evidence of Orcs was found.  

---
### Day 5
The Company advanced into the Dwarrowdelf.  

- Goewen discovered a **letter fragment in Khuzdul**, addressed to kin.  
  - Carrying it grants *favoured rolls on Enhearten*.  
  - She entrusted it to Studs.  
- Entering the **King’s Hall**, the Company triggered *The Death-curse of Durin VI*:  
  - They experienced a haunting vision of the Balrog’s arrival, watching as Durin’s court met its doom in fire and shadow.  
  - Each gained **3 Shadow (Dread)**.  
  - Goewen remembered being entrusted with a **heavy ring of keys** and a **small black pouch**, and sensed where the keys might be found.  
- Flam suffered a **bout of madness**:  
  - He hurled his gear aside and attacked the phantom Orcs.  
  - In his frenzy, his spear struck Goewen, inflicting **4 damage**.

### Day 6
Exploration around the King’s Hall revealed both memory and menace.  

- **Hall of Seven Thrones:**  
  - Studs solved a shifting-tile riddle, uncovering a hidden map leading to a secret passage behind the Hall of Judgment.  

- **Hall of Judgment:**  
  - The Company found a crude Orc gladiatorial arena, built atop the lead plates of exiled Dwarves.  
  - Goewen uncovered a plate tied to Flam’s family.  
  - Flam recognized his responsibility to reclaim and melt it down, restoring his family’s honour.  
- **Secret Passage:**  
  - Studs stealthily scouted the revealed tunnel, confirming it linked to a major passage.  

- **Vision Fulfilled:**  
  - Following the memory of the Ring of Keys, Goewen led the Company to the **tomb of Náin I**.  
  - Along the way, they found a **Steward’s Report** detailing supplies before a siege (extending the Journey by 1 hex).  
  - They deliberately turned from a stairwell heavy with Orc traffic to reach the tomb.  
  - At Náin’s cairn, Goewen recovered the **Ring of Keys**, and discerned their uses.  

The Company rested in the tomb, the heavy keys now in their keeping.
