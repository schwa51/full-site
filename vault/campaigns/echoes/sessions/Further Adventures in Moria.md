## Recap

### Day 1
The party decides to leave West Moria and commence the work of mapping a safe route through Moria, looking for orcs on the way.

They decide to Journey, with Studs as Guide, Flam as Delver, Goewen as Scout and Damirror as Lookout. They successfully traveled 5 /12 miles to the door out of West Moria to the Main Road through Moria. However, they got a little turned around and ended up in a deserted orc den full of foul air, with all members of the party but Goewen (who passed the HEALING test) getting impacted by the foul air. The impact was disfavored on the next test.

They did not see any sign of Orcs in this area.

---
### Day 2
While journeying, they encountered **The Deadly Dark**, with Damirror taking a wound and the **eye awareness** increasing to 9. They then discovered **The Right Way**, and were able to make good progress.

They were not able to discern whether Orcs were present or not in this area.

---
### Day 3
Goewen healed Damirror of his wound. They were able to travel a free 10 miles this day due to **The Right Way** the day before.

---
### Day 4
Another uneventful day. They traveled successfully and narrowly missed another encounter with **The Deadly Dark**.

They were not able to discern whether Orcs were present or not in this area.

---
### Day 5
They did not travel far this day, but were able to make it to the start of the Dwarrowdelf. Goewen found a letter fragment- written in Khuzdal to kin. Carrying this grants favored to Enhearten. Goewen gave the fragment to Studs.

They entered The King’s Hall, triggering The _Death-curse of Durin VI._ They have a vision of the King’s Hall as it was on the day the Balrog came. They imagine that they were in the hall as flames licked the door and the King and his court prepared for their doom; they gain 3 points of Shadow (Dread) as they ‘remember’ the Balrog blasting into the hall and slaughtering all the Dwarves. In addition, Goewen ‘remembered’ the King entrusting a heavy ring of keys and a small black pouch to her, and she knew generally where the keys were.

Flam suffered a bout of madness from the 3 Shadow points and threw all his gear and started attacking the “memory” of the orcs and the Balrog. He launched his spear at the memory of orcs, striking Goewen, inflicting 4 damage.


---
### Day 6
They explore the area around The King’s Hall. They find the Hall of Seven Thrones and The Hall of Judgement. In the Hall of Seven Thrones, Studs find a set of odd-looking tiles on the wall that move. They turn out to be a riddle that he solves, revealing a map with a hidden passaged at the back of The Hall of Judgement. Within The Hall of Judgment, they find a palisade marking out a ring that the orcs have been using for sport- like a gladiatorial arena. The floor is where lead plates holding the names of exiled dwarves rest. Goewen discovers a plate that she feels belongs to Flam. Flam immediately _knows_ it is his family. He feels an immense responsibility to now melt this down and restore his family to good-standing.

Studs stealthily explores the tunnel, finding it connects to another main passageway. Using her attachment to the Ring of Keys she saw in her vision in The King’s Hall, Goewen leads the party toward the cairn of Náin I, the resting place of the keys. While traveling a stairwell clearly used frequently by large numbers of orcs, they discover a Steward’s Report: tally of supplies left before a siege. Journey extends 1 hex.

They continue the opposite direction from the orc path on the stairwell and find the tomb of Nain and the [[The Ring of Keys]]. When holding the keys, she is able to discern their uses.

They rest here for the night.
