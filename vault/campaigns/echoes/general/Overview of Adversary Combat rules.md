#### STATBLOCK

1.     Endurance is hit points.

2.     Might = number of attacks per round and number of wounds (from piercing blows) the Adversary can withstand.

3.     Resolve/Hate* = Hope. Used to power fell abilities. They can also spend to add a d6 to a roll. If at zero, they are _weary_. Adversaries can only spend up to their Might score in one round.

4.     Parry is added to the player TN to hit on the player's turn.

5.     Armour = same as players. (Protection from piercing blows.)

6. Combat proficiency.

·       Presented as "Weapon Type x (y/z)"

·       x is the proficiency rating

·       y is the damage of the weapon.

·       z is the injury rating.

#### ATTACKING

·       When attacking, the Adversary needs to _equal or_ beat the Parry Rating of the targeted player using a feat die + (x)d6

·       if the blow lands it deals y damage.

·       T runes add a special damage option (see Pg 144).

·       If the enemy rolls a 10 or an @ (eye symbol) on the feat die, it's a piecing blow.

·       Player must roll PROTECTION of a fate die + (armour value)d6 and beat the z value of the weapon to avoid the wound.

#### DEFENDING

·       Player rolls to _equal or_ beat their strength TN + Adversary Parry rating.

·       On a successful blow they deal damage to Adversary endurance.

·       If they land a piercing blow, the Adversary has to roll PROTECTION: fate die + d6(armour value) to beat the injury rating of weapon used. @ = immediate success. (Same as players.)

#### DON'T FORGET

·       Fell abilities!!

·       Racial specific abilities. E.g. Undead can reset their endurance completely by spending hate(!), and Trolls just take a piercing blow when reduced to zero endurance and then recover half endurance if they're not killed.

*Adversaries using Resolve can be negotiated with: add this to the TN for a roll to end the fight using something like Persuade, Battle, or Awe. Lower Resolve therefore = easier. Not sure it's RAW but I give them a bonus die if the Adversary is Weary. Conversely, those with Hate might flee, but otherwise just want to kill the PCs.
