### Travel in Moria:
A Journey starts by the players choosing from one of the four roles, with all roles needing to be covered. A player may cover more than one role except for the Guide. Roles are important during Journey events.
#### Travel Roles:<br>
**Guide-** In charge of all decisions concerning route, rest, and supplies. **TRAVEL**<br>
**Look-­out-** In charge of keeping watch. **EXPLORE**<br>
**Scout-** In charge of setting up camp, opening new trails. **AWARENESS**<br>
**Delvers**- their function is to ensure the safety of the marching Company, inspecting tunnels, monitoring environmental conditions, and in general mitigating risks connected to the structures of an underground complex. **CRAFT**<br>

As soon as the Company leaves, the Guide makes a first Marching Test, and counts a number of miles along the journey path based on the outcome of the **TRAVEL** roll:<br>
♦ If the **TRAVEL** roll was a failure, the Company barely makes any progress, advancing by 2 miles on the journey path. Then, an event occurs.<br>
♦ If the **TRAVEL** roll was a success, the Guide has struck a good path and the Company advances 6 miles, plus 2 additional miles for each Success icon. Then, an event occurs.

Events are determined by the loremaster rolling a skill die to choose the party member who will test the indicated skill:<br>

      <th>Target</th>
      <th>Skill</th>
    </tr>

<br>
The target then tests the indicated skill using the Skill Die. The Loremaster then roles a feat die to determine the event occurring according to the following table:<br>

      <td>3–5</td>
      <td>Watchful Eyes</td>

      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6–9</td>
      <td>Endlessly Branching Stairs and Passages</td>
      <td>If the skill roll fails, add 1 day to the length of the journey, and the target gains 1 additional Fatigue. In addition, regardless of whether the roll is successful or not, roll on the Random Chamber Generator.</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>The Right Way</td>
      <td>If the skill roll succeeds, reduce the length of the journey by 1 day.</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>G rune</td>
      <td>Dread and Wonder of Moria</td>
      <td>If the skill roll fails, the target gains 1 Shadow point (Dread). If the skill roll succeeds, everyone in the Company regains 1 Hope instead.</td>
      <td>–</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

At the end of the journey, accumulated fatigue is recorded on the player's sheet. Fatigue can be reduced with a roll of **TRAVEL**. A success reduces the total Fatigue of a Player-­hero by 1, plus 1 point for each icon rolled.

#### Note:
The following modifications to the underground journey rules can be used when the Player-­heroes venture into Moria in search of a place they’ve heard about but lack precise information concerning its location (for example, a place they have discovered using the Gather Rumours undertaking).<br>
The minimum requirement is to know the approximate area where the Landmark is supposed to be found.<br>
To find such a place, the Company must use the normal rules for underground journeys to reach the approximate region. Once there, the Company must make a Seeking Test, to pinpoint the precise location and reach it.<br>
A Seeking Test is made rolling **SCAN**, modified by the Landmark’s Renown: if the Landmark is Famous, the roll is resolved normally; if the Landmark is Obscure, the roll loses (1d); if the Landmark is Hidden, it can be found only with a Magical success (if the Company has found enough clues pointing to the Landmark, this one may be considered Obscure for the sake of the Seeking Test).<br>
♦ If the Test is successful, the Player-­ heroes either find the Landmark sought — or, if the gathered rumours were false in the first place, they confirm that it is not nearby.<br>
♦ If the Test fails, the Company does not find the Landmark and must roll once on the Moria Journey Events table.
