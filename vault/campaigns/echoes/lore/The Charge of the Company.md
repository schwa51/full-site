**Friends**, you have been chosen for a task of great honor — and great peril. Long have I dreamed of restoring Khazad-dûm, Durin’s halls of old, to our people. Yet before we can reclaim the kingdom, we must know what remains of it. You are to go before us, from the West to the East, and learn what lies within the dark.</p>

Your mission is threefold:

- **Exploration** — Search out the great halls and landmarks of Khazad-dûm, and record their present state. 
- **Reconnaissance** — Learn where the Orcs make their dwellings, their numbers, and their movements.  
- **Route-finding** — Discover the safest road through Moria, that our company may follow in strength.

## **Exploration and Lore**
Herein are some notes and memories of tales passed down to me of great *Khazad-dûm* before the fall.

### **The East-gate**
At the head of the Dimrill Dale stands the *East-gate of Khazad-dûm* — once the grandest entrance to any realm of our kind. Its arch was said to be tall enough to swallow Ancalagon the Black himself, its doors of iron bound with *mithril*, opening smooth as thought. The runes upon its lintel bade all to depart without the leave of Moria’s lord.

But take heed — it was here King Thrór entered, and here he was slain. The Orcs lie thick about the ruins of that gate even now. Approach with caution.

---

### **Old Moria**
These are the oldest halls of **Khazad-dûm**— where Durin the Deathless first raised his hammer and began our labors beneath the mountain. Here, too, our people made their last stand when Durin’s Bane awoke. The scars of that battle will still be seen — and perhaps felt.

It is said the Orcs have made their dens here. Expect filth, ruin, and worse things still. Yet among the ashes of our defeat may lie relics of the elder days.

#### **The First Hall**
Durin’s first dwelling — carved before the Sun rose over Middle-earth. Its walls once bore the likeness of Aulë and the history of our beginnings. Some claim the carvings were cut away and hidden ere the fall. If you find them, mark the place well.

#### **Durin’s Bridge**
A single span of stone over a bottomless chasm, fashioned by arts now lost. It was said that one warrior could hold it against an army. If it still stands, it is our surest defense. Cross it with care, for one misstep would see you fall into darkness unending.

#### **The Second Hall**
Wider than the first, held up by pillars like the trunks of trees. Once a marketplace, now a ruin. Here Durin VI’s son, Náin, made his final stand to cover the retreat of our people. Should his tomb yet remain, honor it.

### **Dwarrowdelf**
The very heart of Khazad-dûm — Durin’s city. The Dwarrowdelf was the jewel of our craft, a city of statues and starlit halls, built more for beauty than number. Many of its roads climb toward the light, others descend toward the Deeps.

If fortune favors us, we may yet see those lamps burn again.

#### **The Chamber of Mazarbul**
The Chamber of Records — Mazarbul. There are ledgers and maps there that could prove invaluable. If it still stands, recover what you can. The secrets of Moria’s roads, vaults, and treasures may sleep within those books.

---

### **The Deeps**
Beneath the Dwarrowdelf lie the Deeps — the great forges and mines that fed our strength. The Upper Deeps rang once with hammer and anvil; below them stretch the Lower Deeps, where our miners chased *mithril* to the mountain’s roots. Now they are silent — or not entirely so. Goblins are said to trade and revel in the darkness below.

#### **The Armouries of the Third Deep**
Seek the armouries if you can find them. The first may be looted, but deeper vaults may yet hold blades and mail of our making. Even a few recovered suits would arm our vanguard.

#### **The Wailing Stairs**
A stair descending to the depths, where the wind wails like mourning voices. None know what lies at the bottom. Some say it reaches the very foundations of stone. Mark it well, but do not linger.

---

### **The Upper Levels**
High above the city stand the Mountain Galleries — once bright with terraces and open air. Elves from Hollin once walked there beside our kin. From those balconies, Durin IV watched the armies of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men march south. When the Balrog came, the Dwarves sealed the stairs, cutting off the heights. No Dwarf has set foot there in an age.

#### **The High Cistern**
Fed by the Silverlode’s meltwater, it once supplied the upper halls. The Dwarves of old built mighty sluices to govern its flow. If the waters still run, we may yet restore life to these upper ways.

## **Reconnaissance Objectives**

- Determine where the Orcs have gathered in greatest number.  
- Estimate their strength and leaders, if any.  
- Chart their main routes and camps.  
- Learn what purpose drives them — mining, raiding, or darker labors.

---

## **Route-finding Objectives**

- Identify a passable route from the East-gate to the West.  
- Mark impassable roads or collapsed chambers.  
- Find, if possible, a way that avoids the Orc dens entirely.

Go with Durin’s blessing my friends! May the light of the forge guide your path.  When next we meet, may it be beneath a crown of stone, or on the shores of the Mirrormere in the great Dimril Dale.
— *Balin, son of Fundin*
