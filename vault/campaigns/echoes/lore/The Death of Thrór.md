Years afterwards, Thrór, now old, poor, and desperate, gave to his son Thráin the one great treasure he still possessed, the last of the Seven Rings, and then he went away with one old companion only, called Nár.  Of the Ring he said to Thráin at their parting:
"This may prove the foundation of new fortune for you yet, though that seems unlikely. But it needs gold to breed gold."
"Surely you do not think of returning to Erebor?" said Thráin.
"Not at my age," said Thrór. "Our vengeance on Smaug I bequeath to you and your sons. But I am tired of poverty and the scorn of Men. I go to see what I can find." He did not say where.
He was a little crazed perhaps with age and misfortune and long brooding on the splendour of Moria in his forefather's days; or the Ring, it may be, was turning to evil now that its master was awake, driving him to folly and destruction. From Dunland, where he was then dwelling, he went north with Nár, and they crossed the Redhorn Pass and came down into Azanulbizar.
When Thrór came to Moria the Gate was open. Nár begged him to beware, but he took no heed of him, and walked proudly in as an heir that returns. But he did not come back. Nar stayed nearby for many days in hiding. One day he heard a loud shout and the blare of a horn, and a body was flung out on the steps. Fearing that it was Thrór, he began to creep near, but then there came a voice from within the gate:
"Come on, beardling! We can see you. But there is no need to be afraid today. We need you as a messenger."
Then Nár came up, and found that it was indeed the body of Thrór, but the head was severed and lay face downwards. As he knelt there, he heard orc-laughter in the shadows, and the voice said:
"If beggars will not wait at the door, but sneak in to try thieving, that is what we will do to them. If any of your people poke their foul beards in here again, they will fare the same. Go and tell them so! But if his family wish to know who is now king here, the name is written on his face. I wrote it! I killed him! I am the master!"
Then Nár turned the head and saw branded on the brow in dwarf-runes so that he could read it the name AZOG. That name was branded in his heart and in the hearts of all the dwarves afterwards. Nár stooped to take the head, but the voice of Azog said:
"Drop it! Be off! Here's your fee, beggar-beard." A small bag struck him. It held a few coins of little worth.
Weeping, Nár fled down the Silverlode, but he looked back once and saw that Orcs had come from the gate and were hacking up the body and flinging the pieces to the black crows.
