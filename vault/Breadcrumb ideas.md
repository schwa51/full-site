## 🧭 Two-Node Breadcrumb Template

### 🌟 Discovery Title: *The Memory Beneath the Leaves*

---

### 🪧 Node A: `[[N5 – Gemstreet & Vault Ends]]`

**Clue Fragment:**  
A faded mural shows three robed figures. One gestures toward a stylized silver-leafed tree. Beneath, a partially legible inscription reads:  
> _“…the memory held beneath the leaves…”_

**If visited first:**  
- PCs are intrigued by the tree motif but do not recognize it.
- Awareness or Lore rolls reveal it may symbolize legacy or hiding places.
- Sketching or recalling this later can be a key trigger in Node B.

**If visited second:**  
- Players immediately recognize the tree depicted matches a real one in N2.
- May prompt return visit or insight on prior discovery.

**NPC Hook:**  
- `[[Maeril]]` mutters: “I’ve seen that tree before… near the orchard wall.”

---

### 🌿 Node B: `[[N2 – Ashen Garth (Hidden Orchard)]]`

**Echoed Element:**  
A living tree with silver inlays shaped like those seen in the mural at N5.

**Discovery (if mural seen):**  
- Insight, Song, or Explore prompts PCs to check near the tree roots.
- Hidden cache contains: *Forging schematic fragment* + a riddle stanza:
  > _“Stone and starlight, memory in flame—/To wake what sleeps, name the name.”_

**Discovery (if mural not seen):**  
- Tree appears beautiful but nothing more.
- PCs may miss the clue unless prompted by a companion or NPC.

**NPC Hook:**  
- `[[Roric]]`: “That tree glinted strangely at night... metal in its bark, maybe.”

### 💡 Breadcrumb Design Pattern

| Node | Discovery | Standalone Effect | Combined Effect |
|------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| A (N5) | Visual reference | Mild curiosity | Recognizes clue in Node B |
| B (N2) | Physical clue | Hidden unless symbol is known | Unlocks vault or lore |

## 🧭 Two-Node Breadcrumb: *The Song of Twin Forges*

---

### 🔨 Node A: `[[N3 – Vaultward Steps (Collapsed Forge Hall)]]`

**Clue Fragment:**  
On a cracked forge stone, faint runes reveal themselves when heated:  
> _“Where flame once danced, its echo lingers / One forge sang, but its twin remains.”_

**If visited first:**  
- Lore or Insight roll hints this is a reference to a *paired structure*.
- Players may infer that something is “missing” or hidden elsewhere in the city.
- Dwarf PCs feel an eerie sense of recognition.

**If visited second:**  
- This inscription confirms suspicions raised by architectural patterns seen in N9.

**NPC Hook:**  
- `[[Garan]]` may scoff: “Twin forges? Fairy tales. One was enough for ruin.”

---

### 🌀 Node B: `[[N9 – Cradle of Memory (Spiral Roadway)]]`

**Echoed Element:**  
The spiral layout of the pathway mimics the layout seen on the cracked stone in N3. One chamber contains a buried chamber door sealed in mithril and stone.

**Discovery (if N3 seen):**  
- PCs can match the spiral path and recognize its *missing center* — the “twin” forge.  
- Exploration or Craft rolls allow them to discover the entrance.

**Discovery (if N3 not seen):**  
- Strange chamber, but purpose unclear. Might feel mystical or Elvish, rather than Dwarven.

**NPC Hook:**  
- `[[Maeril]]` hesitates at the chamber: “This place… wasn’t made by Elves alone.”

## 🧭 Two-Node Breadcrumb: *The Words in Star-Shaped Stone*

---

### 🌠 Node A: `[[N10 – Ghosted Lane (Shrine of Varda)]]`

**Clue Fragment:**  
Dwarvish runes in a star pattern, half-obscured by moss:  
> _“When stars align, the path lies beneath the mountain’s mouth.”_

**If visited first:**  
- PCs are intrigued by the strange Dwarven reference to “the mountain’s mouth.”
- Lore rolls can connect it to legends of Moria’s many names.
- Without context, may be dismissed as symbolic.

**If visited second:**  
- This inscription becomes vital when the map fragment found in N4 references the same “mouth.”

**NPC Hook:**  
- `[[Anárion]]` tries to steer them away: “Varda’s shrine holds only silence now.”

---

### 🗺️ Node B: `[[N4 – Riverfall Market (Trading Hall Debris)]]`

**Echoed Element:**  
Amid scattered scrolls and ledgers, a map fragment references trade routes through “Durin’s Mouth” — now forgotten by most.

**Discovery (if N10 seen):**  
- PCs make the connection: “Durin’s Mouth” is real — an alternate westward path into Moria.  
- May update their mental map of where Balin should go next.

**Discovery (if N10 not seen):**  
- The phrase is odd, not fully understood. PCs might pocket the map without deeper insight.

**NPC Hook:**  
- `[[Roric]]`: “My grandfather spoke of Durin’s Mouth once... a path lost to flood or fear.”
